The\nEDK Build Tools are included as part of the EDK II compatibility package. In\norder to use EDK II Modules or the EDK II Build Tools, an EDK II DSC and FDF\nfile must be used.\nEDK II tools use INI style text based files to describe components, platforms\nand firmware volumes. While similar to EDK DSC files, the EDK II DSC file\nformat is different, and new utilities have been provided to process these\nfiles.\nThe EDK II Build Infrastructure supports creation of binary images that comply\nwith Unified EFI (UEFI) 2.5 and UEFI Platform Infrastructure (PI) 1.4\nspecifications.\nThis design has the following goals.\nCompatible\nThe EDK II DSC format does not support EDK DSC format, nor can EDK tools be\nused to parse the EDK II DSC format files. \nSimplified platform build and configuration\nOne goal of this format is to simplify the build setup and configuration for a\ngiven platform. It was also designed to simplify the process of adding EDK II\nfirmware components to a firmware volume on a given platform.\nTable 1 describes the compatibility between platform, module and component\nbuilds.\nTable 1 EDK Build Infrastructure Support Matrix\n\n\n\n\nEDK DSC\nEDK II DSC\nEDK FDF\nEDK II FDF\nEDK INF\nEDK II INF\n\n\n\n\nEDK Build Tools\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\nEDK II Build Tools\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n\n\nNote: This document is intended for persons doing EFI development and\nsupport for different platforms. It is most likely only of interest in the\nevent that there is a problem with a build, or if a developer needs to perform\nspecial customizations of a build for a platform. This document is most likely\nonly of interest in the event that there is a problem with a build, or if a\ndeveloper needs to perform special customizations of a build for a platform.\n\nThe EDK II build processes, defined in the EDK II Build Specification, use\nseparate steps to create EFI images. The EDK II DSC file is used in conjunction\nwith EDK II Flash Description files (FDF), EDK II DEC, EDK II module INF and\nEDK component INF files to generate binary PE32/PE32+/Coff files. The EDK II\nMakefiles, generated by the EDK II parsing tool, contain only enough\ninstructions to build the PE32/PE32+/Coff image files. These makefiles do not\ncontain information on the EFI format for FFS or FV file creation. The\nMakefiles will support third party compilation tools - Microsoft, Intel and GCC\ntool chains - and at least one EDK II tool, GenFw. The GenFw tool is used to\nmanipulate the files emitted from the compilation tools.\nThe EDK II build provides UEFI and PI (Unified EFI, Inc.)\nspecification-compliant images. \n"},"1_introduction/12_terms.html":{"url":"1_introduction/12_terms.html","title":"1.2 Terms","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

DXE SAL\nmodules differ from DXE Runtime modules in that the DXE Runtime modules support\nVirtual mode OS calls at OS runtime and DXE SAL modules support intermixing\nVirtual or Physical mode OS calls.\nDXE SMM\nA special class of DXE module that is loaded into the System Management Mode\nmemory.\nDXE Runtime\nSpecial class of DXE module that provides Runtime Services\nEBNF\nExtended \"Backus-Naur Form\" meta-syntax notation with the following additional\nconstructs: square brackets \"[...]\" surround optional items, suffix \"*\" for a\nsequence of zero or more of an item, suffix \"+\" for one or more of an item,\nsuffix \"?\" for zero or one of an item, curly braces \"{...}\" enclosing a list of\nalternatives and super/subscripts indicating between n and m occurrences.\nEDK\nExtensible Firmware Interface Development Kit, the original implementation of\nthe Intel(R) Platform Innovation Framework for EFI Specifications developed in\n2007.\nEDK II\nEFI Development Kit, version II that provides updated firmware module layouts\nand custom tools, superseding the original EDK.\nEDK Compatibility Package (ECP)\nThe EDK Compatibility Package (ECP) provides libraries that will permit using\nmost existing EDK drivers with the EDK II build environment and EDK II\nplatforms.\nEFI\nGeneric term that refers to one of the versions of the EFI specification: EFI\n1.02, EFI 1.10 or any of the UEFI specifications.\nFDF\nEDK II Flash definition file. This file is used to define the content and\nbinary image layouts for firmware images, update capsules and PCI option ROMs.\nFLASH\nThis term is used throughout this document to describe one of the following:\n\nAn image that is loaded into a hardware device on a platform - traditional\nROM image\n\nAn image that is loaded into an Option ROM device on an add-in card\n\nA boot able image that is installed on removable, boot able media, such as a\nFloppy, CD-ROM or USB storage device.\n\nAn image that is contains update information that will be processed by OS\nRuntime services to interact with EFI Runtime services to update a\ntraditional ROM image.\n\nA UEFI application that can be accessed during boot (at an EFI Shell Prompt),\nprior to hand-off to the OS Loader.\n\n\nFoundation\nThe set of code and interfaces that glue implementations of EFI together.\nFramework\nIntel(R) Platform Innovation Framework for EFI consists of the Foundation, plus\nother modular components that characterize the portability surface for modular\ncomponents designed to work on any implementation of the Tiano architecture.\nGUID\nGlobally Unique Identifier. A 128-bit value used to name entities uniquely. A\nunique GUID can be generated by an individual without the help of a centralized\nauthority. This allows the generation of names that will never conflict, even\namong multiple, unrelated parties. GUID values can be registry format\n(8-4-4-4-12) or C data structure format.\nGUID also refers to an API named by a GUID.\nHII\nHuman Interface Infrastructure. This generally refers to the database that\ncontains string, font, and IFR information along with other pieces that use one\nof the database components.\nHOB\nHand-off blocks are key architectural mechanisms that are used to hand off\nsystem information in the early pre-boot stages.\nIFR\nInternal Forms Representation. This is the binary encoding that is used for the\nrepresentation of user interface pages.\nINF\nEDK II Module Information File. This file describes how the module is coded.\nFor EDK, this file describes how the component or library is coded as well as\nproviding some basic build information.\n\nSource INF - An EDK II Module Information file that contains content in a\n[Sources] section and it does not contain a [Binaries] section. If the\n[Binaries] section is empty or the only entries in the [Binaries] section are\nof type DISPOSABLE, then the [Binaries] section is ignored.\n\nBinary INF - An EDK II Module Information file that has a [Binaries] section\nand does not contain a [Sources] section or the [Sources] section is empty.\n\nMixed INF - An EDK II Module Information file that contains content in both\n[Sources] and [Binaries] sections and there are entries in the [Binaries]\nsection are not of type DISPOSABLE.\n\nAsBuilt INF - An EDK II Module Information file generated by the EDK II build\nsystem when building source content (listed in a [Sources] section).\n\n\nLibrary Class\nA library class defines the API or interface set for a library. The consumer\nof the library is coded to the library class definition. Library classes are\ndefined via a library class .h file that is published by a package.\nLibrary Instance\nA module implementation of one or more library classes.\nModule\nA module is either an executable image or a library instance. For a list of\nmodule types supported by this package, see module type.\nModule Type\nAll libraries and components belong to one of the following module types:\nBASE, SEC, PEI_CORE, PEIM, DXE_CORE, DXE_DRIVER,\nDXE_RUNTIME_DRIVER, DXE_SMM_DRIVER, DXE_SAL_DRIVER, UEFI_DRIVER, or\nUEFI_APPLICATION. These definitions provide a framework that is consistent\nwith a similar set of requirements. A module that is of module type BASE,\ndepends only on headers and libraries provided in the MDE, while a module that\nis of module type DXE_DRIVER depends on common DXE components. The EDK II build\nsystem also permits modules of type USER_DEFINED and HOST_APPLICATOIN.\nThese modules will not be processed by the EDK II Build system. For a\ndefinition of the various module types, see Appendix C.\nPackage\nA package is a container. It can hold a collection of files for any given set\nof modules. Packages may be described as one of the following types of modules:\n\nsource modules, containing all source files and descriptions of a module\n\nbinary modules, containing EFI Sections or a Framework File System and a\ndescription file specific to linking and binary editing of features and\nattributes specified in a Platform Configuration Database (PCD,)\n\nmixed modules, with both binary and source modules\n\n\nMultiple modules can be combined into a package, and multiple packages can be\ncombined into a single package.\nPCD\nPlatform Configuration Database.\nPEI\nPre-EFI Initialization Phase.\nPEIM\nAn API named by a GUID.\nPPI\nA PEIM-to-PEIM Interface that is named by a GUID.\nProtocol\nAn API named by a GUID.\nRuntime Services\nInterfaces that provide access to underlying platform-specific hardware that\nmight be useful during OS runtime, such as time and date services. These\nservices become active during the boot process but also persist after the OS\nloader terminates boot services.\nSAL\nSystem Abstraction Layer. A firmware interface specification used on Intel(R)\nItanium(R) Processor based systems.\nSEC\nSecurity Phase is the code in the Framework that contains the processor reset\nvector and launches PEI.

This distinction means that the low-order byte of a multi\nbyte data item in memory is at the lowest address, while the high-order byte is\nat the highest address.\nProcessors of the Intel(R) Itanium(R) processor family may be configured for\nboth \"little endian\" and \"big endian\" operation. All implementations designed\nto conform to this specification will use \"little endian\" operation.\nIn some memory layout descriptions, certain fields are marked reserved.\nSoftware must initialize such fields to zero and ignore them when read. On an\nupdate operation, software must preserve any reserved field.\nThe data structures described in this document generally have the following\nformat:\nSummary\nA brief description of the data structure.\nPrototype\nAn EBNF-type declaration for the data structure.\nExample\nSample data structure using the prototype.\n1.4.2 Pseudo-Code Conventions\nPseudo code is presented to describe algorithms in a more concise form. None of\nthe algorithms in this document are intended to be compiled directly.

Additional chapters describe different sections of the\nEDK II DSC file in detail.\nEDK II parsing tools contain the templates for processing files to create the\ncomponent binary images from source files. EDK II Binary Modules are not\nrequired to be included in EDK II DSC files (they must be included if the\nBinary Module uses PCDs that use PatchableInModule or DynamicEx PCD access\nmethods). EDK II DSC files are a list of:\n\nEDK II Module INF Files\nEDK Components\nEDK libraries (only used by EDK Components)\nEDK II Library Class Instance Mappings (only used by EDK II Modules)\nEDK II PCD Entries\n\nThere are no new features or format introduced in this specification.\nDSC files that use any new features must use the new\nDSC_SPECIFICATION = 0x0001001C in the [Defines] section. Older DSC files\nthat do not use any of these features do not need to update the\nDSC_SPECIFICATION value.\nThis version of the specification reflects changes to the EDK II reference\nbuild system that has been updated to support builds using EDK II Packages that\nare located in directories outside of the directory specified by the system\nenvironment variable, WORKSPACE.\nAn EDK II Package (directory) is a directory that contains an EDK II package\ndeclaration (DEC) file.\nThe EDK II build system has been updated to allow the setting of multiple paths\nthat will be searched when attempting to resolve the location of EDK II\npackages. This new feature allows for more flexibility when designing a tree\nlayout or combining sources from different sources. The new functionality is\nenabled through the addition of a new environment variable (PACKAGES_PATH).\nThe PACKAGES_PATH variable is an ordered list of additional search paths using\nthe default path separator of the host OS between each entry ( \";\" on Windows,\n\":\" on Linux and OS/X). The path specified by the WORKSPACE variable always has\nthe highest search priority over any PACKAGE_PATH entries. The first path (left\nto right) in the PACKAGES_PATH list has the highest priority and the last path\nhas the lowest priority.\nFor the remainder of this document, unless otherwise specified (using \"system\nenvironment variable, WORKSPACE\"), references to the WORKSPACE and\n$(WORKSPACE) refer to the ordered list of directories specified by the\ncombination of WORKSPACE + PACKAGES_PATH. The build system will automatically\njoin the directories and search these paths to locate content, with the first\nmatch terminating the search. For example given the following set of\nenvironment variables, and the MdeModulePkg is located in both the edk2 and\nedk2Copy directories, the build system would use the C:\\work\\edk2\\MdeModulePkg\nwhen attempting to locate the MdeModulePkg.dec file.\nset WORKSPACE=c:\\work\nset PACKAGES_PATH=c:\\work\\edk2;c:\\work\\edk2Copy\nBuild tools will stop searching when the first location is resolved.\nRefer to the TianoCore.org web-site for more information on the EDK II build\nsystem.\n\nNote: Path and Filename elements within the DSC are case-sensitive in order\nto support building on UNIX style operating systems. Use of \"/../\" in a path\nand, \"./\" or \"../\" at the start of a path is prohibited.\n\nNote: This document uses \"\\\" to indicate that a line that cannot be\ndisplayed in this document on a single line. Within the DSC specification, each\nentry must appear on a single line.\n\nNote: The total path and file name length is limited by the operating\nsystem and third party tools. It is recommended that for EDK II builds that the\nWORKSPACE (or directories listed in the PACKAGESPATH system environment\nvariable) directory be either a directory under a subst drive in Windows\n(s:/build as an example) or be located in either the /opt directory or in the\nuser's /home/username directory for Linux and OS/X.\n\n"},"2_dsc_overview/21_processing_overview.html":{"url":"2_dsc_overview/21_processing_overview.html","title":"2.1 Processing Overview","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

However, while the intent of a component's\nINF file is to define the source files, libraries (or library classes), and\ndefinitions relevant to building the component, the function of the platform\nDSC file is to specify the library instances, components and output formats\nused to generate binary files that will be processed by other tools to generate\nan image that is either put into a flash device, made available for recovery\nbooting or updating existing firmware on a platform.\n\nNote: For users familiar with EDK, the EDK II DSC file is not used to\nspecify how compiled binary images get placed into UEFI/PI compliant binaries.\nThe EDK II Flash Description File (FDF) file specifies how to package the\nbinaries files into UEFI/PI compliant images.\n\nIn general, the parsing utilities read each line from the sections of the\nplatform description (DSC) file, process the component, module, or library's\nINF file on the line to generate a makefile, and then continue with the next\nline.\nFigure 1 illustrates the process flow, with the dark format indicating the\nprocess for building PE/PE32+/Coff files.\n\nFigure 1 EDK II Parsing Data Flow\n"},"2_dsc_overview/22_build_description_file_format.html":{"url":"2_dsc_overview/22_build_description_file_format.html","title":"2.2 Build Description File Format","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The binary files can be distributed as\nEDK II binary packages or used to create a platform are defined in an FDF file,\nrather than the EDK II DSC file unless the binary modules included in a platform\nuse PCDs.\n2.2.1 Section Entries\nTo simplify parsing, the EDK II meta-data files continue using the INI format.\nThis style was introduced for EDK meta-data files, when only the Windows tool\nchains were supported. It was decided that for compatibility purposes, that INI\nformat would continue to be used. EDK II formats differ from the de facto INI\nformat in that the semicolon \";\" character cannot be used to indicate a\ncomment.\nLeading and trailing space/tab characters must be ignored.\nDuplicate section names must be merged by tools.\nThis description file consists of sections delineated by section tags enclosed\nwithin square [] brackets. Section tag entries are case-insensitive. The\ndifferent sections and their usage are described below. The text of a given\nsection can be used for multiple section names by separating the section names\nwith a comma. For example:\n[LibraryClasses.X64, LibraryClasses.EBC]\nThe content below each section heading is processed by the parsing utilities in\nthe order that they occur in the file. The precedence for processing these\narchitecture section tags is from right to left, with sections defining an\narchitecture having a higher precedence than a section which uses common (or no\narchitecture extension) as the architecture.\n\nNote: Content, such as filenames, directory names, macros and C variable\nnames, within a section IS case sensitive. IA32, Ia32 and ia32 within a section\nare processed as separate items. (Refer to Naming Conventions below for more\ninformation on directory and/or file naming.)\n\nSections are terminated by the start of another section or the end of the file.\nComments are not permitted between square brackets of a section specifier.\nDuplicate sections (two sections with identical section tags) will be merged by\ntools, with the second section appended to the first.\nIf architectural modifiers are used in the section tag, the section is merged\nby tools with content from common sections (if specified) with the\narchitectural section appended to the first, into an architectural section. For\nexample, given the following:\n[BuildOptions]\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /nologo\n\n[BuildOptions.IA32]\n  MSFT:*_*_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /D MDEPKG_NDEBUG\n\n[BuildOptions.X64]\n  MSFT:*_*_X64_CC_FLAGS = /Gy\n\nAfter the first pass of the tools, when building the module for IA32, the\nsource files will logically be:\n[BuildOptions.IA32]\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS    = /nologo\n  MSFT:*_*_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /D MDEPKG_NDEBUG\n\nWhen building the module for X64, the source files will logically be:\n[BuildOptions.X64]\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS   = /nologo\n  MSFT:*_*_X64_CC_FLAGS = /Gy\n\nThe [Defines] section tag prohibits use of architectural modifiers. All other\nsections can specify architectural modifiers.\n2.2.2 Comments\nThe hash \"#\" character indicates comments in the Platform Description (DSC)\nfile. In line comments terminate the processing of a line. In line comments\nmust be placed at the end of the line, and may not be placed within the section\n[] tags.\nOnly FIX_LOAD_TOP_MEMORY_ADDRESS = 0xF0000000 in the following example is\nprocessed by tools; the remainder of the line is ignored:\nFIX_LOAD_TOP_MEMORY_ADDRESS = 0xF0000000 # set top memory address\n\nNote: Blank lines and lines that start with the hash \"#\" character\nmust be ignored by tools.\n\nHash characters appearing within a quoted string are permitted, with the string\nbeing processed as a single entity. The following example must handle the\nquoted string as single element by tools.\nUI = \"# Copyright 2007, NoSuch, ltd. All rights reserved.\"\n2.2.3 Valid Entries\nProcessing of the line is terminated if a comment is encountered.\nProcessing of a line is terminated by the end of the line.\nItems in quotation marks are treated as a single token and have the highest\nprecedence. Items encapsulated in parenthesis are also treated as tokens, with\nembedded tokens being processed first. All other processing occurs from left to\nright.\nIn the following example, B - C is processed first, then result is added to A\nfollowed by adding 2; finally 3 is added to the result.\n(A + (B - C) + 2) + 3\nIn the next example, A + B is processed first, then C + D is processed and\nfinally the two results are added.\n(A + B) + (C + D)\nSpace and tab characters are permitted around field separators.\n2.2.4 Naming Conventions\nThe EDK II build infrastructure is supported under Microsoft Windows, Linux*\nand MAC OS/X operating systems. All directory and file names must be treated as\ncase sensitive because of multiple environment support.\n\nThe use of special characters in directory names and file names is restricted\nto the dash, underscore, and period characters, respectively \"-\", \"_\", and\n\".\".\n\nPeriod characters may not be followed by another period character. File and\nDirectory names must not start with \"./\", \".\" or \"..\".\n\nDirectory names and file names must not contain space characters.\n\nDirectory Names must only contain alphanumeric characters, the dash and\nunderscore characters and start with an alpha character. A single period\ncharacter is permitted in the name provided that alphanumeric characters\nappear before and after the period character (as in: MdePkg.1).\n\nAdditionally, all EDK II directories that are architecturally dependent must\nuse a name with only the first character capitalized. Ia32, X64 and Ebc\nare valid architectural directory names. IA32, X64 and EBC are not acceptable\ndirectory names, and may cause build breaks. From a build tools perspective,\nIA32 is not equivalent to Ia32 or ia32.\n\n\nThe build tools must be able to process the tool definitions file:\ntools_def.txt (describing the location and flags for compiler and user\ndefined tools), which may contain space characters in paths on Windows* systems.\n\nNote: The toolsdef.txt file and [BuildOptions] sections are the\nplaces that permit the use of space characters in a directory path.\n\nThe EDK II Coding Style specification covers naming conventions for use within\nC Code files, and as well as specifying the rules for directory and file names.\nThis section is meant to highlight those rules as they apply to the content of\nthe INF files.\nArchitecture keywords (IA32, X64 and EBC) are used by build tools\nand in metadata files for describing alternate threads for processing of files.\nThese keywords must not be used for describing directory paths. Additionally,\ndirectory names with architectural names (Ia32, X64 and Ebc) do\nnot automatically cause the build tools or meta-data files to follow these\nalternate paths. Directories and Architectural Keywords are similar in name\nonly.\nAll directory paths within EDK II INF files must use the \"/\" forward slash\ncharacter to separate directories as well as directories from filenames.\nExample:\nC:/Work/Edk2/edksetup.bat\nFile names must also follow the same naming convention required for\ndirectories. No space characters are permitted. The special characters\npermitted in directory names are the only special characters permitted in file\nnames.\n2.2.5 !include Statement Processing\nThe !include statement may appear within any section of EDK II DSC file. The\nincluded file content must match the content type of the current section\ndefinition, contain complete sections, or combination of both. And the keyword\n!include is case-insensitive.\nThe argument of this statement is a filename. The file is relative to the\ndirectory that contains this DSC file, and if not found the tool must attempt\nto find the file relative to the paths listed in the system environment\nvariable $(WORKSPACE). If the file is still not found, the parsing tools \nmust terminate with an error.\nMacros, defined in this file, are permitted in the path or file name of the\n!include statement, as these files are included prior to processing the file\nfor macros. The system environment variable $(WORKSPACE), may also be used; \nonly these system environment variables are permitted to start the path of the \nincluded file.\nStatements in !include files must not break the integrity of the DSC file,\nthe included file is read in by tools in the exact position of the file, and is\nfunctionally equivalent of copying the contents of the included file and\ninserting (paste) the content into the DSC file.\nThe following examples show the valid usage of the !include statement.\n[LibraryClasses]\n  BaseLib|MdePkg/Library/BaseLib/BaseLib.inf\n  !include MyPlatformCommonLibs.txt\n\n[LibraryClasses]\n  DEFINE MDELIBUAEP = MdePkg/Library/UefiApplicationEntryPoint\n  UefiApplicationEntryPoint|$(MDELIBUAEP)/UefiApplicationEntryPoint.inf\n  !include Sample.txt\n\n  ### Contents of Sample.txt\n  DEFINE EMULATE = 1\n\n  !if $(EMULATE) == 0\n  [LibraryClasses.IA32]\n    TimerLib|Some/Existing/TimerLib/Instance.inf\n\n  [LibraryClasses.X64]\n    TimerLib|Another/Existing/TimerLib/Instance.inf\n  !else\n    TimerLib|The/NULL/TimerLib/Instance.inf\n  !endif\n\n2.2.6 Macro Statements\nThe use of MACRO statements, which assign a value to a variable. Macros defined\nin the [Defines] section are considered global during the processing of the\nDSC file and the FDF file. This means that a Macro can be used in the FDF file\nwithout defining it in the FDF as long as it is defined in the DSC file.\nToken names (words defined in the EDK II meta-data file specifications) cannot\nbe used as macro names. As an example, using PLATFORM_NAME as a macro name is\nnot permitted, as it is a token defined in the DSC file's [Defines] section.\nMacros in the DSC file can be used to specify paths (and paths and filenames),\nand build options. They can define other items, such as values for PCDs,\nexpressions or names that can be used in conditional directive statements,\nwhich allows customization of the build, allowing the platform integrator to\nselect features from the command-line.\nThe format for the macro statements is:\nDEFINE MACRO = Path\nAny portion on a path or path and filename can be defined by a macro.\nWhen assigning a string value to a macro, the string must follow the C format\nfor specifying a string, as shown below:\nDEFINE MACRO1 = \"SETUP\"\nDEFINE MACRO2 = L\"SETUP\"\nWhen assigning a numeric value to a macro, the number may be a decimal, integer\nor hex value, as shown below:\nDEFINE MACRO1 = 0xFFFFFFFF\nDEFINE MACRO2 = 2.3\nDEFINE MACRO3 = 10\nThe format for usage of a Macro varies. When used as a value, the Macro name\nmust be encapsulated by \"$(\" and \")\" as shown below:\n$(MACRO)/filename.foo\nWhen a macro is tested in a conditional directive statement, determining\nwhether it has been define or undefined uses the following format:\n!ifdef MACRO\n\nNote: For backward compatibility, tools may allow $(MACRO) in the\n!ifdef and !ifndef statements. This functionality may disappear in\nfuture releases, therefore, it is recommended that platform integrators update\ntheir DSC files if they also alter other content.\n\nWhen using string comparisons of Macro elements to string literals, the format\nof the conditional directive must be:\n!if $(MACRO) == \"Literal String\"\n\nNote: For backward compatibility, tools may allow testing literal strings\nthat are not encapsulated by double quotation marks. This functionality may\ndisappear in future releases, therefore, it is recommended that platform\nintegrators update their DSC files if they also alter other content.\n\nWhen testing Macro against another Macro:\n!if $(MACROALPHA) == $(MACROBETA)\nWhen testing a Macro against a value:\n!if $(MACRONUM) == 2\nor\n!if $(MACROBOOL) == TRUE\nWhen used with the !if or !elseif statements or in an expression used in a\nvalue field, a macro that has not been defined has a value of 0.\nAny defined MACRO definitions will be expanded by tools when they encounter the\nentry in the section except when the macro is within double quotation marks in\nbuild options sections. The expectation is that macros in the quoted values\nwill be expanded by external build scripting tools, such as nmake or gmake;\nthey will not be expanded by the build tools. If a macro that is not defined is\nused in locations that are not expressions (where the tools would just do macro\nexpansion as in C flags in a [BuildOptions] section), nothing will be\nemitted. If the macro, MACRO1, has not been defined, then:\nMSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /c /nologo $(MACRO1) /Od\nAfter macro expansion, the logical result would be equal to:\nMSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /c /nologo /Od\nIt is recommended that tools remove any excess space characters when processing\nthese types of lines.\nMacro evaluation is done at the time the macro is used in an expression,\nconditional directive or value field, not when a macro is defined. Macros in\nquoted strings will not be expanded by parsing tools; all other macro values\nwill be expanded, without evaluation, as other elements of the build system\nwill perform any needed tests. Macro Definition statements that appear within a\nsection of the file (other than the [Defines] section) are scoped to the\nsection they are defined in. If the Macro statement is within the [Defines]\nsection, then the Macro is considered global to the entire DSC file, files\nincluded using the !include statement and global to the FDF file, with local\ndefinitions taking precedence (if the same MACRO name is redefined in\nsubsequent sections, then that MACRO value is local to only that section.)\nMacros may be used in conditional statements located within the DSC (and FDF)\nfile. Conditional MACROs may be defined on a command line of a parsing tool. It\nis highly recommended that a macro defined in this manner have a DEFINE\nstatement to set a default value in the [Defines] section. (Macro values\nspecified on the command-line override all definitions of that Macro.) In the\nreference build (Nt32Pkg/Nt32Pkg.dsc), macros set on a command line override\nany macro value defined in the DSC (or FDF) file.\nMACROs may also be used as values in PCD statements. See Section 3.10 for\nmore information on PCD statements.\nMacros that appear within double quotation marks in build options sections are\nnot expanded. It is assumed that they will be expanded by the OS or external\nscripting tools.\nGlobal variables that may be used in EDK II DSC and FDF meta-data files are\nlisted in the Well-known Macro Statements table, while the format of the\nSystem Environment variables that may be used in EDK II DSC and FDF files are\nin the next table.\nTable 2 Well-known Macro Statements\n\n\n\nExact Notation\nDerivation\n\n\n\n\n$(OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)\nUsed in FDF [FV] and [Capsule] sections; the value comes from parsing either the DSC file or via a command line option. This is commonly the Build/Platform name directory created by the build system in the EDK II WORKSPACE, however, it is possible to specify the output directory outside of the EDK II WORKSPACE.\n\n\n$(TARGET)\nUsed in various locations; valid values are derived from INF, DSC, target.txt, tool options and tools_def.txt. FDF parsing tools may obtain these values from command-line options.\n\n\n$(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG)\nUsed in various locations; valid values are derived from INF, DSC, target.txt, tool options and tools_def.txt. FDF parsing tools may obtain these values from command-line options.\n\n\n$(TOOLCHAIN)\nA synonym for $(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG), with the value derived from INF, DSC, target.txt and tools_def.txt.\n\n\n\nThis item has been deprecated, and must not be used.\n\n\n$(ARCH)\nUsed in various locations, valid values are derived from INF, DSC, target.txt, tool options and tools_def.txt. FDF parsing tools may obtain these values from command-line options.\n\n\n\nSystem environment variables may be referenced, however their values must not\nbe altered.\nTable 3 Using System Environment Variable\n\n\n\nMacro Style Used in Meta-Data Files\nMatches Windows Environment Variable\nMatches Linux & OS/X Environment Variable\n\n\n\n\n$(WORKSPACE)\n%WORKSPACE%\n$WORKSPACE\n\n\n$(EDK_TOOLS_PATH)\n%EDK_TOOLS_PATH%\n$EDK_TOOLS_PATH\n\n\n\nThe system environment variables, PACKAGES_PATH and EDK_TOOLS_BIN, are not\npermitted in EDK II meta-data files.\nMacros defined in the DSC file's [Defines] section may be used within an FDF\nfile. They are also positional in nature, with later definitions overriding\nprevious definitions for the remainder of the file.\nAdditionally, the macros defined in the DSC file may be used in conditional\ndirective statements located within the DSC and FDF files. Macros in the DSC\nfile can be used for file names, paths, PCD values, in the [BuildOptions]\nsection, on the right (value) side of the statements and in conditional\ndirectives. Macros can also be defined or used in the [Defines],\n[LibraryClasses], [Libraries], [Components] and all PCD sections.\nMacros defined by the user cannot be used in the !include statements in\neither the DSC or FDF file.\nMacros defined in common sections may be used in the architecturally modified\nsections of the same section type. Macros defined in architectural sections\ncannot be used in other architectural sections, nor can they be used in the\ncommon section. Section modifiers in addition to the architectural modifier\nfollow the same rules as architectural modifiers.\nExample\n[LibraryClasses.common]\n  DEFINE MDE = MdePkg/Library\n  BaseLib|$(MDE)/BaseLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.X64, LibraryClasses.IA32]\n  # Can use $(MDE), cannot use $(MDEMEM)\n  DEFINE PERF = PerformancePkg/Library\n  TimerLib|$(PERF)/DxeTscTimerLib/DxeTscTimerLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.X64.PEIM]\n  # Can use $(MDE) and $(PERF)\n  DEFINE MDEMEM = $(MDE)/PeiMemoryAllocationLib\n  MemoryAllocationLib|$(MDEMEM)/PeiMemoryAllocationLib.inf\n\n[LibraryClasses.EBC]\n  # Cannot use $(PERF) or $(MDEMEM)\n  # Can use $(MDE) from the common section\n  PalLib|$(MDE)/UefiPalLib/UefiPalLib.inf\n  TimerLib|$(MDE)/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate/BaseTimerLibNullTemplate.inf\n\n2.2.7 Conditional Directive Statements (!if...)\nConditional directive statements are used by the build tools preprocessor\nfunction to include or exclude statements in the DSC file. A limited number of\nstatements are supported, and nesting of conditionals is also supported.\nStatements are prefixed by the exclamation \"!\" character. Conditional\nstatements may appear anywhere within the DSC file.\n\nNote: A limited number of statements are supported. This specification does\nnot support every conditional statement that C programmers are familiar with.\n\nSupported following statements and the keyword are case-insensitive:\n!ifdef, !ifndef, !if, !elseif, !else and !endif\nRefer to the Macro Statement section for information on using Macros in\nconditional directives.\nWhen using the !ifdef or !ifndef, the macro name can be used; the macro\nname must not be encapsulated between $( and ). It is the name of the macro\nthat is used for testing, not the value of the macro.\nPCDs must not be used in the !ifdef or !ifndef statements.\n\nNote: For backward compatibility, the EDK II build system will also process\nthe !ifdef or !ifndef statements with the macro encapsulated between\n\"$(\" and \")\".\n\nWhen using a marco in the !if or !elseif conditionals, the macro name must\nbe encapsulated between $( and ).\nA macro that is not defined has a default value of 0 (FALSE) when used in a\nconditional comparison statement.\nWhen using a PCD in the !if or !elseif conditionals, the PCD name\n(TokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdCname) can be used; the PCD name must not be\nencapsulated between \"$(\" and \")\" nor between \"PCD(\" and \")\". Do not\nencapsulate the PCD name in the \"$(\" and \")\" required for macro values as shown\nin the example below.\n!if ( gTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname == 1 ) AND ( $(MY_MACRO) == TRUE )\nDEFINE FOO=TRUE\n!endif\nIf the PCD is a string, only the string needs to be encapsulated by double\nquotation marks, while a Unicode string can have the double quoted string\nprefixed by \"L\", as in the following example:\n!if gTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname == L\"Setup\"\nDEFINE FOO=TRUE\n!endif\nIf a PCD is used in a conditional statement, the value must first come from the\nFDF file, then from the DSC file. If the value cannot be determined from these\ntwo locations, the build system should break with an error message.\n\nNote: PCDs, used in conditional directives, must be defined and the value\nset in either the FDF or DSC file in order to be used in a conditional\nstatement; values from INF or DEC files are not permitted.\n\nWhen used in !if and !elseif conditional comparison statements, it is the\nvalue of the Macro or the PCD that is used for testing, not the name of the\nmacro or PCD.\nStrings can only be compared to strings of a like type (testing an ASCII string\nagainst a Unicode format string must fail), numbers can only be compared\nagainst numbers and boolean objects can only evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. See\nthe Operator Precedence table, in the Expressions section below for a list of\nrestrictions on comparisons.\nUsing macros in conditional directives that contain flags for use in the\n[BuildOptions] sections is not recommended.\nThe following external macro names can be used in conditional directives\nwithout defining them in DSC or FDF files.\nTable 4 Well-known Macro Statements\n\n\n\nTag\nValue\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n$(FAMILY)\nTool Chain Family\nThe value must be a string comparison against a FAMILY value that is defined in the Conf/ tools_def.txt file\n\n\n$(TARGET)\nBuild Target\nThe value must be a string comparison against a TARGET value that is defined in the Conf/ tools_def.txt file\n\n\n$(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG)\nTool Chain Name\nThe value must be a string comparison against a tool chain tag name value that is defined in the Conf/tools_def.txt file.\n\n\n$(ARCH)\nArchitecture\nThe value must be a string comparison against an architecture that is defined in the Conf/ tools_def.txt file.\n\n\n\nThe macro values listed above are derived from the build command-line options\n(highest priority) or the Conf/target.txt file. They may be combined in\ndirective statements using logical expressions.\nMost section definitions in the EDK II meta-data files have architecture\nmodifiers. Use of architectural modifiers in the section tag is the recommended\nmethod for specifying architectural differences. Some sections do not have\narchitectural modifiers and there are some unique cases where having a method\nfor specifying architectural specific items would be valuable, hence the\nability to use these values.\nThe following are examples of conditional directives.\n!if (\"MSFT\" IN $(FAMILY)) or (\"INTEL\" IN $(FAMILY))\n... statements\n!elseif $(FAMILY) == \"GCC\"\n... statements\n!endif\n\n!ifdef FOO\n  !ifndef BAR\n    # FOO defined, BAR not defined\n  !else\n    # FOO defined, BAR is defined\n  !endif\n!elseif $(BARFOO)\n  # FOO is not defined, BARFOO evaluates to TRUE\n!elseif $(BARFOO) == $(FOOBAR)\n  # FOO is not defined, BARFOO equals the value of FOOBAR\n  # (in this case, FALSE)\n!else\n  # FOO is not defined while BARFOO evaluates to FALSE and FOOBAR\n  # evaluates to TRUE\n!endif\n\n!if $(FOO) == 2\n  # The numeric value of FOO was defined as 2, as in DEFINE FOO = 2\n!endif\n\n!if MyTspGUID.MyPcd == 2\n  # The value of PCD, MyTspGUID.MyPcd, is 2\n!endif\n\n!if $(FOO) == \"MyPlatformName\"\n  # This is a string comparison, where the MACRO FOO was set using:\n  # DEFINE FOO = \"MyPlatformName\"\n!endif\n\n!if MyTspGUID.MyTspGUID == \"MyPlatform\"\n  # This is a string comparison where PCD VOID* value is \"MyPlatform\",\n  # and must be a null terminated string.\n!else\n  # The strings do not match exactly\n!endif\n\n2.2.8 !error Statement\nThe !error statement may appear within any section of EDK II DSC file. The\nargument of this statement is an error message, it causes build tool to stop\nat the location where the statement is encountered and error message following\nthe !error statement is output as a message. The keyword !error is not\ncase-sensitive.\nThe following example show the valid usage of the !error statement.\n!if $(FEATURE_ENABLE) == TRUE\n  !error \"unsupported feature!\"\n!endif\n\n2.2.9 Expressions\nExpressions can be used in conditional directive comparison statements and in\nvalue fields for Macros and PCDs in the DSC and FDF files.\nRefer to the EDK II Expression Syntax Specification for additional information.\n\nNote: Note that the data types are not required to be literal numbers, but\nrather they can be a Macro or a PCD whose value is a number or a boolean. The\nsame rule applies for strings, where the value of the Macro or a VOID* PCD can\nbe tested as a string.\n\nTable 5 Operator Precedence and Supported Operands\n\n\n\nOperator\nUse with Data Types\nNotes\nPriority\n\n\n\n\n? :\nAll\nconditional operator\nLowest\n\n\nor, OR, ||\nNumber, Boolean\n\n\n\n\nXOR, xor\nNumber, Boolean\n\n\n\n\nand, AND, &&\nNumber, Boolean\n\n\n\n\n|\nNumber, Boolean\nBitwise OR\n\n\n\n^\nNumber, Boolean\nBitwise XOR\n\n\n\n&\nNumber, Boolean\nBitwise AND\n\n\n\n==, !=, EQ, NE, IN\nAll types\nThe IN operator can only be used to test a quoted unary literal string for membership in a list.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrings compared to boolean or numeric values using \"==\" or \"EQ\" will always return FALSE, while using the \"!=\" or \"NE\" operators will always return TRUE\n\n\n\n, >=, , >, LE, GE, LT, GT\nAll\n\n\n\n\n, >>\nNumber, Boolean\n\n\n\n\n+, -\nNumber, Boolean\nCannot be used with strings - the system does not automatically do concatenation.\n\n\n\n*, /, %,\nNumber, Boolean\nCannot be used with strings.\n\n\n\n!, not, NOT, ~\nNumber, Boolean\n\nHighest\n\n\n\nThe \"IN\" operator can only be used to test a literal string against elements\nin the following global variables:\n$(FAMILY)\n$(FAMILY) is considered a list of families that different TOOL_CHAIN_TAG\nvalues belong to. The TOOL_CHAIN_TAG is defined in the Conf/target.txt or\non the command-line. The FAMILY is associated with the TOOL_CHAIN_TAG in\nthe Conf/tools_def.txt file (or the TOOLS_DEF_CONF file specified in the\nConf/target.txt file) file. While different family names can be defined,\nARMGCC, GCC, INTEL, MSFT, RVCT, RVCTCYGWIN and XCODE have been predefined in\nthe tools_def.txt file.\n$(ARCH)\n$(ARCH) is considered the list of architectures that are to be built, that\nwere specified on the command line or come from the Conf/target.txt file.\n$(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG)\n$(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG) is considered the list of tool chain tag names specified on\nthe command line\n$(TARGET)\n$(TARGET) is considered the list of target (such as DEBUG, RELEASE and NOOPT)\nnames specified on the command line or come from the Conf/target.txt file.\nFor logical expressions, any non-zero value must be considered TRUE.\nInvalid expressions must cause a build break with an appropriate error message.\n2.2.10 Section Handling\nThe DSC file parsing routines must process the sections so that common\narchitecture sections are logically merged with the architecturally specific\nsections. The architectural sections need to be processed so that they are\nlogically after the common section. It is recommended that EDK II developers\nuse a logical ordering of the sections.\nOther section modifiers must also be logically appended to the merged sections\n(for DSC files that have architectural and common architecture sections) after\nthe merge.\nFor [BuildOptions] sections in the DSC file, the entries with a common left\nside (of the \"=\") will be either appended or replace previous entries based\non the \"==\" replace or \"=\" append assignment character sequence.\n  Common Section + Architectural Section + Common Section w/extra Modifier\n  + Architectural Section w/extra Modifier\nExample:\n[BuildOptions.Common]\n  MSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /nologo\n\n[BuildOptions.IA32]\n  MSFT:*_*_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /D EFI32\n\nFor IA32 architecture builds of an EDK II INF file would logically be:\nMSFT:*_*_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /nologo /D EFI32\n"},"2_dsc_overview/23_[defines]_section_processing.html":{"url":"2_dsc_overview/23_[defines]_section_processing.html","title":"2.3 [Defines] Section Processing","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

If the value contains space characters, then the\nvalue must be a quoted string. The PREBUILD and POSTBUILD entry support\nmultiple arguments, and tool will convert the arguments that are WORKSPACE or\nPACKAGES_PATH relative paths to absolute paths. Quotes may be used for arguments\nthat have spaces or special characters. The build tool suspends processing of\nthe DSC file if the PREBUILD entry is present, calls the script, and either\nterminates or continues processing the DSC file depending on the exit code from\nthe script. If the POSTBUILD entry is present, prior to the successful build\nexit, the script is called. If the script fails (non-zero exit code from the\nscript) build terminates immediately using the exit code returned from the\nscript, otherwise, build terminates normally. The author of the script is\nresponsible for ensuring that the script terminates with a non-zero exit code\nwhen it fails.\nAll defined elements of the DSC file's [Defines] section are valid when\nparsing the FDF file. The these elements must be treated as Macros when using\nthem in other sections of the DSC and FDF file, as in $(PLATFORM_NAME).\nThe use of the DEFINE MACRO = Value statements in this section globally\ndefine the MACRO name during the processing of this file, files included by the\n!include statement and the FDF file.\n\nWarning: The DEFINE MACRO = Value statements in other sections are local to\nthe section, and override the global definition for entries in the section that\nfollow the macro definition: DEFINE MACRO = Value.\n\nThe EDK II tools will locate the FDF file specified in the FLASH_DEFINITION\nentry in the same directory as the DSC file. When the PCD_VAR_CHECK_GENERATION\nentry is present and set to TRUE, tools will generate a binary file for\nDynamicHii and DynamicExHii PCD variable checking.\nThe following table lists the valid content of this section and whether the\nitem is required.\nTable 6 EDK II [Defines] Section Elements\n\n\n\nTypical Tag Names\nRequired / Optional\nValue\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nDSC_SPECIFICATION\nRequired\n0x0001001C or 1.28\nThis entry is required for all EDK II DSC files. The value, 0x0001001C matches the 1.28 version of this specification. Build tools must continue to support DSC files that correspond to earlier versions of the document until such time as earlier versions are no longer in use. In order to maintain backward compatibility, this value must only be updated in existing DSC files if other content in the file is updated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis value may also be specified as decimal value, i.e., 1.28.\n\n\nPLATFORM_GUID\nRequired\nRegistry Format GUID(8-4-4-4-12)\nThe GUID value, along the PLATFORM_VERSION, is used to uniquely identify a platform file.

These flags are\nappended to any standard flags that are defined by the build process. They can\nbe applied for any modules or those modules on the specific ARCH or those\nmodules with the specific EDKII module style. In order to replace the\nstandard flags that are defined by the build process, an alternate assignment\noperator is used; \"==\" is used for replacement, while \"=\" is used to append\nthe flag lines. In addition to flags, other tool attributes may have the item\neither appended or replaced.\nValid content is within this section is limited to the following description.\nTable 7 EDK II [BuildOptions] Section Elements: Optional Tags\n\n\n\nTag\nValue\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n${FAMILY}:${TARGET}_${TAGNAME}_ ${ARCH}_${TOOLCODE}_FLAGS\nFlags for specific tool codes for this module\nUsed to specify module specific flags.\n\n\n${FAMILY}:${TARGET}_${TAGNAME}_ ${ARCH}_${TOOLCODE}_PATH\nThe fully qualified path an executable\nUsed to replace a specific command, such as forcing the ASL to be iasl, instead of asl.\n\n\n${FAMILY}:${TARGET}_${TAGNAME}_ ${ARCH}_${TOOLCODE}_DPATH\nA fully qualified path\nA path that will be added to the system Environment's PATH variable prior to executing a command.\n\n\n${FAMILY}:${TARGET}_${TAGNAME}_ ${ARCH}_${TOOLCODE}_${ATTRIBUTE}\nAttribute specific string\nThis permits overriding other attributes if required.\n\n\n\nTable 8 EDK II [BuildOptions] Variable Descriptions\n\n\n\nVariable\nRequired\nWildcard\nSource\n\n\n\n\nFAMILY\nNO\nNo\nConf/tools_def.txt defines FAMILY as one of MSFT, INTEL or GCC.

Library Classes allow modules to be coded\nfor a library class, and then allow platform integrator then chooses a Library\nInstance based on a priori knowledge of the instances. Library Instances are\nclassified using the architecture types they have been coded for as well as the\nsupported EDK II module types. As an example, within EDK II, the library class,\nDebugLib has seven potential instances, only one of which may be linked to a\nsingle component. To support a given module type selection, the\n[LibraryClasses] section header can optionally specify the EDK II module type\n(following the supported architecture field). This is permitted as some library\ninstances can be used by any or all module types.\nThis is a an optional section for EDK II DSC files only if there are no EDK II\nmodules used by the DSC file.\nThe following is the generic format for the specifying a section\n[LibraryClasses]\n[LibraryClasses.IA32]\n[LibraryClasses.X64]\n[LibraryClasses.EBC]\n[LibraryClasses.common]\n\nFormat for entries in this section is as follows:\nLibraryClassName|Path/To/LibInstanceName.inf\nLibraryClassName1|Path/To/LibInstanceName1.inf\n\nNote: \"LibraryClassName\" is a keyword in the first field of the above\nexample format can not be NULL.

If no instance is found for the library class, the build\ntools must fail with an error similar to the following.\nERROR: Library Class [$(LibClassName)] specified by the Module [$(InfFileName)] does not have a Library Class Instance Defined.\nBuild tools can propose fixes, as shown in the following:\n\nCheck for spelling of the Library Class Name for the module in the components\nsection, or\n\nCheck the EDK II Packages (sub‐directories in directories pointed to by\nWORKSPACE or PACKAGES_PATH system environment variables) for a library\ninstance that satisfies the Library Class, then add that instance to the DSC\nfile in the correct Library Class section.\n\n\nThe selected library instance is added to the LIBS definition in the output\nmakefile:\nLIBS = $(LIBS) $(LIB_DIR)/$(LibInstanceName)\nPCDs that are used by a library instance are resolved using the PCD settings of\nthe driver linking the library instance.

The five access methods are:\nFeatureFlag, FixedAtBuild, PatchableInModule, Dynamic and DynamicEx\nPCDs.\n2.7.1.1 FeatureFlag and Dynamic PCD Types\nThe two recommended access methods that are commonly used in modules are\nFeatureFlag and the generic Dynamic method. The Dynamic form is used for\nconfiguration when the PCD value is produced and consumed by drivers during\nexecution, the value may be user configurable from setup or the value is\nproduced by the platform in a specified area. It is associated with modules\nthat are released in source code. The dynamic form is the most flexible method,\nas platform integrators may chose a to use a different access method for a\ngiven platform without modifying the module's INF file or the code for the\nmodule.\n2.7.1.2 DynamicEx, FixedAtBuild and PatchableInModule PCD Access Methods\nSimilar in function, the DynamicEx access method can be used with modules\nthat are released as binary. The FixedAtBuild and PatchableInModule PCDs\nare static and only the PatchableInModule PCD can have the value changed in a\nbinary prior to including the module in a firmware image.\nThe platform integrator must check DEC file that declares the PCD to determine\nthe PCD's valid access methods. If a module defines a PCD as dynamic (not\nDynamicEx), and the DEC file lists the PCD under all access methods, the\nplatform integrator can specify any access method (basically making a dynamic\nPCD into a static, fixed PCD) overriding the INF module definition. However, if\na module declares a PCD is coded to use a specific access method , then the\nplatform integrator must select that PCD access method. For example, if a PCD\nis listed as FixedAtBuild in a module file, then the platform integrator must\neither list the PCD in a [PcdsFixedAtBuild] section of the DSC or let the\ntools use the default value and automatically set the PCD access method to\nFixedAtBuild. It is not necessary to modify an INF file in order to use this\nfeature - the tools will automatically \"correct\" the PCD access method for\nplatforms that use an alternate access method for Dynamic PCDs.\nThe content in these sections is used for generating the AutoGen.c and\nAutoGen.h files for each of the EDK II modules that are coded for the PCD.\n[Pcds(PcdType)]\n[Pcds(PcdType).common]\n[Pcds(PcdType).IA32]\n[Pcds(PcdType).X64]\n[Pcds(PcdType).EBC]\n\n2.7.2 PCD Access Method Categories\nOf the five access methods of PCDs that have been defined, they fall into one\nof three categories:\n\nFeatureFlag - always has a Boolean value.\n\nFixedAtBuild and PatchableInModule, will have a value of one of three\ndatum types, Boolean, numeric or pointer. The FixedAtBuild PCD will be a\ndefined as a const, while the PatchableInModule will be defined as volatile.\n\nDynamic and DynamicEx, will have a value of one of the three data types,\nBoolean, numeric or pointer.\n\n\n\nNote: For the dynamic types of PCDs, using an $(Arch) extension other\nthan common in the section header is not valid.\n\nWarning: A PCD can only use one type for all source modules. It is not\npermissible to list a PCD in a PcdsFixedAtBuild section and also list it in a\nPcdsPatchableInModule section.\n\nNote: Binary modules included in a platform build are permitted to use the\nPatchableInModule or DynamicEx access methods (the Binary module must specify\nwhich of these two methods were used to create the binary module) regardless of\nthe method used for a given PCD in modules built from source. The build supports\nbinary modules that use the same or different PCD access method than the source\nmodules or other binary modules. The build parser must break with an error if a\nPCD is listed as FixedAtBuild or Dynamic (not DynamicEx) in the Binary INF.\n\nDatum Types for PCD values are either Boolean (BOOLEAN - 1 byte), numeric\n(UINT8 - 1 byte, UINT16 - 2 bytes, UINT32 - 4 bytes or UINT64 - 8\nbytes) or variable length (VOID, which indicates that the value is usually\naccessed via a pointer). To put a limit on the number of bytes for a variable\nlength value (when the PCD Datum Type is VOID) the PCD entry must include\nthe MaximumDatumSize parameter. The MaximumDatumSize parameter is optional\nfor all other PCD data types.\n\nWarning: A FixedAtBuild or PatchableInModule PCD may have a\ndifferent datum type based on the architecture. For example, a PCD that is used\nfor address manipulation may have a datum type of UINT32 for IA32 and\nUINT64 for X64 and EBC architectures. This will be declared in the EDK II\nPackage Declaration (DEC) File.\n\n2.7.3 PCD Section Usage\nPCD sections are optional unless the EDK II modules specified in the\n[Components] section use PCDs.\nThe PCD sections are used to define the access method for a PCD. Since each\nmodule is built once for a given architecture, the PCD can be listed under\ndifferent PCD access methods provided they are listed under different\narchitectures.\n2.7.3.1 Access Methods\nHowever, once a PCD access method is selected for a given architecture, the PCD\ncan only use that access method.\nExample\nA PCD that will use the FixedAtBuild access method for IA32 cannot use the\nPatchableInModule access method for individual modules built for the IA32\narchitecture.\n2.7.3.2 Different Access Methods\nIt is permissible to have a PCD use different access methods for different\narchitectures.\nExample\nA PCD that will use the FixedAtBuild access method for IA32 can use the\nPatchable in Module access method for X64.\n2.7.3.3 Item Access Methods\nMultiple item access methods, PcdsFeatureFlag, PcdsFixedAtBuild,\nPcdsPatchableInModule, PcdsDynamic and PcdsDynamicEx are not allowed to\nbe specified within a single [] section tag.\nIncorrect example\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.IA32, PcdsPatchableInModule.IA32, PcdsDynamicDefault.IA32]\n\nCorrect example\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdStatusCodeMemorySize|1\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdResetOnMemoryTypeInformationChange|FALSE\n\n[PcdsPatchableInModule.IA32]\n  gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|0x80000000\n\n[PcdsDynamicDefault.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEmuVariableNvStoreReserved|0\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFlashNvStorageVariableBase64|0\n\n2.7.3.4 Mixing PCD Dynamic item storage methods\nIt is not permissible to mix different PCD Dynamic item storage methods within\na single section, as the format for the PCD entries in PcdsDynamicDefault,\nPcdsDynamicVpd, PcdsDynamicHii, and PcdsDynamicExDefault, PcdsDynamicExVpd and\nPcdsDynamicExHii sections are different.\nIncorrect Example\n[PcdsDynamicExDefault.IA32, PcdsDynamicExVpd.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEmuVariableNvStoreReserved|0\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFlashNvStorageVariableBase64|*|0\n\nCorrect Example\n[PcdsDynamicExDefault.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEmuVariableNvStoreReserved|0\n\n[PcdsDynamicExVpd.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFlashNvStorageVariableBase64|*|0\n\n2.7.3.5 Multiple Architectural Section Tags\nIt is permissible to specify multiple architectural section tags for the same\nPCD item type in a single section.\nExample\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.IA32, PcdsFixedAtBuild.X64]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdStatusCodeMemorySize|1\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdResetOnMemoryTypeInformationChange|FALSE\n\n[PcdsPatchableInModule.IA32, PatchableInModule.X64]\n  gEfiMdePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDebugPrintErrorLevel|0x80000000\n\n[PcdsDynamicDefault.IA32, PcdsDynamicDefault.X64]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdEmuVariableNvStoreReserved|0\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdFlashNvStorageVariableBase64|0\n\n2.7.3.6 Dynamic and DynamicEx PCD Storage Methods\nThe PCDs that use Dynamic and DynamicEx access methods can have their values\nstored in one of three different methods, Default, VPD or HII. A PCD using one\nof these access methods can use one storage method. It is not permissible to\nhave a PCD try to store the data in the Default database and a VPD region at\nthe same time.\nThe Default methods ([PcdsDynamicDefault] and [PcdsDynamicExDefault]) rely\non internal databases generated by the build tools and stored as a data segment\nin the PEI and DXE PCD drivers. The format for listing a boolean or numeric\ndatum type PCD in these sections is:\nTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname|\nThe format for listing a VOID* datum type PCD in these sections is:\nTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname||VOID*|\nThe VPD methods ([PcdsDynamicVpd] and [PcdsDynamicExVpd]) rely on data stored\nin read-only memory. The format for listing a boolean or numeric datum type PCD\nin these sections is:\nTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname||\nThe format for listing a VOID* datum type PCD in these sections is:\nTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname|||\nThe HII methods ([PcdsDynamicHii] and [PcdsDynamicExHii]) rely on an HII Data\nStore. The format for listing a PCD in these sections is:\nTokenSpaceGuid.PcdCname|||||\n\nNote: Some of the above fields are optional; refer to \"PCD Sections\" in the\nnext chapter for the exact syntax.\n\n2.7.3.7 Unique PCDs\nUnique PCDs are identified using the format to identify the named PCD:\nTokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdCName\nThe content for a PCD in this section is the PCD's Name (PCD Token Space Guid\nC name, the PCD C name and the optional field name - separated by a period \ncharacter) and Default value. Field entries on a line are separated by the \npipe \"|\" character.\nThis specification prohibits setting different PCD access methods for a single\nPCD in different modules. The access methods here are PcdsFixedAtBuild,\nPcdsPatchableInModule, PcdsDynamic and PcdsDynamicEx.\n\nNote: A future version of this specification and the tool may allow listing\na PCD in both PcdsFixedAtBuild and PcdsPatchableInModule sections. For\nexample, the platform integrator may want to use one module with a given PCD\nas FixedAtBuild, and have a different module with the same PCD use it as\nPatchableInModule.\n\nNote: A PCD that is used as FixedAtBuild for one module, while a different\nmodule may want to use the PCD as PatchableInModule and a third module might\nuse the PCD as DynamicEx. Under normal circumstances, only two of these might\nbe used - PcdsFixedAtBuild for modules with wellknown values for a PCD,\nthen either PcdsPatchableInModule or PcdsDynamicEx - the first\nbeing for testing a module, the second giving the ability for doing individual\ndriver performance tuning \"on-the-fly\".\n\n2.7.3.8 Precedence\nTools must assume that the first method found for a PCD in the PCDs sections\nwill used for all instances of a PCD. Tools must not allow for different\nmodules using a PCD differently, using the  statements under the INF\nfile definitions in the [Components] section.\nTools must process VOID* PCD entries that do not include the maximum length\nfield by determining the maximum length of the PCD values in the DSC, DSC and\nINF files. Size is allocated for \"string\" entries to be the length of the\nstring plus 1 byte for the null terminator, for L\"string\" entries to be the\nlength of the UCS-2 character string plus 2 bytes for the null terminator and\nthe exact length of a byte array.\nThe values that are assigned to individual PCDs required by a build may come\nfrom different locations and different meta-data files. The following provides\nthe precedence (high to low) to assign a value to a PCD.\n\nCommand-line, --pcd flags (left most has higher priority)\n\nDSC file, FeatureFlag, PatchableInModule or FixedAtBuild PCD value defined\nin the [Components] INF scoping  section statements\n\nFDF file, grammar describing automatic assignment of PCD values\n\nFDF file, SET statements within a section\n\nFDF file, SET statement in the [Defines] section\n\nDSC file, a PCD value defined in a PCD access method section with an\narchitectural modifier.\nIn this example, modules built for IA32 architecture, the PCD will use\nPatchableInModule access, while modules built for all other architectures, the\nPCD will use the FixedAtBuild access method:\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.common]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdStatusCodeMemorySize|1\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdResetOnMemoryTypeInformationChange|FALSE\n\n[PcdsPatchableInModule.IA32]\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdStatusCodeMemorySize|1\n  gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdResetOnMemoryTypeInformationChange|FALSE\n\n\nDSC file, A PCD value defined in a PCD access method (item type) global\n[Pcd*] section for common architectures.\n\nINF file, PCD sections, Default Values (provided all INF files have defined\nthe same value)\n\nDEC file, PCD sections, Default Values\n\n\n\nNote: Dynamic or DynamicEx PCD sections with architectural modifiers is not\nallowed unless the platform can only be built using a single architecture, even\nif there is more than one architecture listed in the SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES\nelement in the [Defines] section. When building more than one architecture\nfor a given platform (the platform supports multiple architectures in firmware)\nonly a single value can be used for either a Dynamic or DynamicEx PCD. Therefore,\nlisting PcdsDynamic or PcdsDynamicEx sections with architectural modifiers is\nprohibited in this type of platform description file.\n\nNote: PCD values within a section are positional, (last wins) if a PCD is\nlisted more than one time within a section. List a PCD in one of the other\naccess methods is allowed, provided a single access method must be used for all\ninstances of the PCD. If PCD field value is listed, it will override PCD value \neven if PCD value is after PCD field value.\n\n2.7.3.9 Library Instances\nLibrary Instances that use PCDs that the module is linked with must use the\nsame PCD setting as the module using the Library Instance. So if a module uses\na PCD as PcdsFixedAtBuild, then all library instances that use that PCD must\nalso use the PCD as PcdsFixedAtBuild with the same value.\nBuild Tools must detect missing PCD entries (PCD specified in an INF file, but\nnot in the DSC file) and search the DEC files in the EDK II Packages\n(sub‐directories in directories pointed to by WORKSPACE or PACKAGES_PATH system\nenvironment variables), in order to use the default value from the DEC file. PCD\nValues may be absolute (a number, string, etc.) a MACRO name or an expression.\nThe expression is a C-style expression using C relational, equality and logical\nnumeric and bitwise operators or numeric and bitwise operators that evaluate to\na value that matches the PCD's Datum Type (specified in the DEC package\ndeclaration file.) Precedence and associativity follow C standards. Using PCDs\nin expressions is also permitted.\n2.7.3.10 Maximum Size of a VOID* PCD\nIf the maximum size of a VOID* PCD is not specified in the DSC file, then the\nmaximum size will be calculated based on the largest size of the following:\n\nthe string or array in the --pcd option\n\nthe string or array in the FDF file\n\nthe string or array in the DSC file\n\nthe string or array in the INF file\n\nthe string or array in the DEC file\n\n\nScenario A\nIf for a given PCD and architecture:\n\nThe PCD is not listed anywhere in the DSC file,\n\nIf the PCD is listed in the INF file of at least one of the modules listed\nin the [Components] section,\n\nAll of the modules in the [Components] section that use the PCD, list the\nPCD using the Dynamic access method in their INF files,\n\nThe DEC file has the PCD listed in the sections for Dynamic, Patchable in\nModule and FixedAtBuild,\n\n\nThe build tools must use the FixedAtBuild access method for this PCD in this\nscenario.\nScenario B\nIf for a given PCD and architecture:\n\nThe PCD is not listed anywhere in the DSC file,\n\nIf the PCD is listed in the INF file of at least one of the modules listed\nin the [Components] section,\n\nAll of the modules listed in the [Components] section that use the PCD,\nlist the PCD using the Dynamic access method in their INF files,\n\nThe DEC file has the PCD listed in the sections for Dynamic and\nFixedAtBuild.\n\n\nThe build tools must use the FixedAtBuild access method for this PCD in this\nscenario.\nScenario C\nIf for a given PCD and architecture:\n\nThe PCD is not listed anywhere in the DSC file,\n\nIf the PCD is listed in the INF file of at least one of the modules listed\nin the [Components] section,\n\nOne or more module uses the Patchable in Module access method for the PCD in\nthe INF files,\n\nAll of the other modules listed in the [Components] section that use the\nPCD, list the PCD using the Dynamic access method in their INF files,\n\n\nThe build tools must use the Patchable in Module access method for the PCD in\nall of the modules that use this PCD in this scenario. Since number 3 shows\nthat there are modules that are coded for only patchable in module access, and\nthe EDK II build system requires that for a single architecture a single access\nmethod must be selected for each PCD, no other methods of access, such as\nFixedAtBuild, can be used for modules that may not be coded specifically for\npatchable in module access.\n"},"2_dsc_overview/28_pcd_sections.html":{"url":"2_dsc_overview/28_pcd_sections.html","title":"2.8 PCD Sections","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Additionally, EDK II build tools\nwill not perform any dependency checking for files listed in the INF file nor\non the output object file. EXEC example follows:\nPath/and/Filename.inf EXEC = exe2bin.exe\nThe structure for specifying an EDK II INF filename is as follows:\n$(EDK_SOURCE)/Path/and/ComponentName.inf [options] {\n  # Library Class listing - Required for EDK II components. One or more\n  # Library mapping lines are permitted.\n  \n    LibraryClassName|Path/and/LibraryInstanceName.inf\n  # Followed by zero (no pcds are used by the module) or more of the\n  # following individual component override statements.\n  # Pcd settings are applicable to both Library Instances that\n  # are linked to the component and the component itself.\n  # If a PCD entry is not specified, however the INF files for either\n  # the library classes that are linked to the component, or the\n  # component's INF file require Pcd settings, a globally defined\n  # value for the Pcd ([Pcd{AccessMethod}] section or the default\n  # value from the DEC file that declares the PCD) will be used. If\n  # none of these values are specified, build tools processing this file\n  # should fail with an error message (indicating the missing PCD # entry.)\n  # NOTE: MaximumDataSize is required for VOID* datum type PCDs, and # should NOT be used for either the boolean or numeric datum types.\n  # PcdsDynamic and PcdsDynamicEx cannot be specified in a component # scoped section as these values are platform scoped, not module\n  # scoped.\n  \n    TokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdTokenName|Data[|MaximumDataSize]\n  \n    TokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdTokenName|{TRUE}{FALSE}\n  \n    TokenSpaceGuidCName.PcdTokenName|Data[|MaximumDataSize]\n  # BuildOption Format is identical to the format used for the\n  #tools_def.txt file. Options specified in this section take\n  # precedence over the platform build options specified in the\n  #[Defines] section. (The [Defines] section options take precedence #over options specified in the tools_def.txt file)\n  \n    TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_ARCH_COMMANDTYPE_FLAGS = string of flags\n}\n\nIn order to build a module multiple times, the  tag is used. In the\nfollowing example, the S3Resume2Pei module is built twice, using different\nlibrary instances and PCD values (one for use with IA32 architecture and one\nfor the X64 architecture). The first module instance uses the standard\nFILE_GUID value from the INF file when creating the FFS filename, while the\nsecond module instances will use the FILE_GUID value specified in the DSC\nfile for creating the FFS filename.\n  UefiCpuPkg/Universal/Acpi/S3Resume2Pei/S3Resume2Pei.inf {\n    \n      gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDxeIplSwitchToLongMode|FALSE\n    \n      NULL|BinaryDistributionModulePkg/Library/SwitchToLongMode/SwitchToLongModeDisabledLib.inf\n  }\n  UefiCpuPkg/Universal/Acpi/S3Resume2Pei/S3Resume2Pei.inf {\n    \n      FILE_GUID = 35B57EA0-4A41-4a12-B1F5-5F7B79095301\n    \n      gEfiMdeModulePkgTokenSpaceGuid.PcdDxeIplSwitchToLongMode|TRUE\n    \n      NULL|BinaryDistributionModulePkg/Library/SwitchToLongMode/SwitchToLongModeEnabledLib.inf\n  }\n\nIf the values for the PcdTokenName are specified in the global\n[Pcds{AccessMethod}] section and no values are specified in the INF filename\nsection, then the global values will be used. It should be noted that only\nLibraryClassName|library/instance definitions are required. Adding just the\nlibrary class name without the library instances is for informational purposes\nonly, and they will not be processed.\nExample\nMdeModulePkg/Universal/Disk/DiskIo/Dxe/DiskIo.inf {\n  #EDK II Module\n  \n    DebugLib|MdePkg/Library/PeiDxeDebugLibReportStatusCode/PeiDxeDebugLibReportStatusCode.inf\n    BaseMemoryLib|MdePkg/Library/DxeMemoryLib/DxeMemoryLib.inf\n    MemoryAllocationLib|MdePkg/Library/DxeMemoryAllocationLib/DxeMemoryAllocationLib.inf\n}\n\n"},"2_dsc_overview/211_[userextensions]_section.html":{"url":"2_dsc_overview/211_[userextensions]_section.html","title":"2.11 [UserExtensions] Section","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

The\nthird party utility that is called after all pre-work has been completed is\ndefine in the Conf/tools_def.txt file using the tool code of MAKE. On Windows\nsystems, this will typically point to the (with the fully qualified path)\nutility \"nmake.exe\", while on *NIX systems, the utility is typically just\n\"make\". The build system will also generate a single master makefile, one\nMakefile per architecture specified on the command-line or listed in the\nConf/target.txt file and one Makefile for each for each module or library\ninstance within the architectural tree. Therefore, the build system must be\ncapable of processing and keeping track of common items and architecturally\nspecific content. Common content (not architecturally dependent) will be\nprocessed for each architecture. For example, if -a IA32 -a X64 appear on the\ncommand line, all modules that do not specify an architecture modifier in the\n[Components], [Libraries] or [LibraryClasses] sections will be processed\nso that makefiles for the module entries appear under IA32 and under X64\nsub-directories in the build output tree. Where architectural modifiers are\nused, the build tools will process content such that the modules (and their\nmakefiles) are only under the corresponding architecture trees.\n"},"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/32_general_rules.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/32_general_rules.html","title":"3.2 General Rules","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Additionally, names that\nare C variables or used as a macro are case sensitive. Other elements such as\nsection tags or hex digits, in the DSC file are not casesensitive. The use of\n \"..\", \"../\" and \"./\" in paths and filenames is strictly prohibited.\n\nNote: This document uses \"\\\" to indicate that a line that cannot be\ndisplayed in this document on a single line. Within the DSC specification, each\nentry must appear on a single line.\n\n\nMultiple DSC files may exist in a directory, however it is recommended that\neither the PLATFORM_GUID or the PLATFORM_VERSION be unique to the DSC\nfile. It is recommended that the PLATFORM_NAME and OUTPUT_DIRECTORY also\nbe unique.\n\nText in section tags is case in-sensitive.\n\nA section terminates with either another section definition or the end of the\nfile.\n\nTo append comment information to any item, the comment must start with a hash\n\"#\" character.\n\nAll comments terminate with the end of line character.\n\nField separators for lines that contain more than one field are pipe \"|\"\ncharacters. This character was selected to reduce the possibility of having\nthe field separator character appear in a string, such as a filename or text\nstring.\n\n\n\nNote: The only notable exception is the PcdName which is a combination of\nthe PcdTokenSpaceGuidCName and the PcdCName that are separated by the period \".\"\ncharacter. This notation for a PCD name is used to uniquely identify the PCD.\n\n\nA line terminates with either an end of line character or a comment.\n\nWhen processing numeric values, either integer or hex, leading zeros\nspecified in the entry may be ignored. For example, 0x00000000000000000000001\ncan be a valid value for a UINT8 data type, as the actual value is 1.\n\nAll words in quotation marks in the EBNF in this file must be considered\nreserved. Redefining a reserved word is not permitted.\n\n\n3.2.1 Backslash\nUse of the back slash character \"\\\" in this document is only for lines that\ncannot be displayed within the margins of this document. The backslash\ncharacter must not be used to extend a line over multiple lines in the DSC file.\n3.2.2 Whitespace characters\nWhitespace (space and tab) characters are permitted between token and field\nseparator elements for all entries.\nWhitespace characters are not permitted between the PcdTokenSpaceGuidCName and\nthe dot, nor are they permitted between the dot and the PcdCName.\n3.2.3 Paths for filenames\nNote that for specifying the path for a file name, if the path value starts\nwith a dollar sign \"$\" character, either a local MACRO or system\nenvironment variable is being specified. If the path value starts with one of\n\"letter:\\\", \"/\", \"\\\" or \"\\\" the path must be a fully qualified URI location.\nIf it does not, the specified path is relative to EDK II Packages\n(sub-directories in directories pointed to by WORKSPACE or PACKAGES_PATH system\n environment variables).\n\nCaution: The use of \"..\", \"./\" and \"../\" in a path element is prohibited.\nFor all DSC files, the specified directory path must use the forward slash\ncharacter for separating directories. For example, MdePkg/Include/ is Valid.\n\nNote: If the platform integrator is working on a Microsoft Windows*\nenvironment and will not be working on a non-windows platform, then the\nDOS-style directory separator can be used. The forward slash Unix-style\ndirectory separator is mandatory for distributions where the build environment\nis unknown.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all file names and paths are relative EDK II Packages\n(subdirectories in directories pointed to by WORKSPACE or PACKAGES_PATH system\nenvironment variables). A directory name that starts with a word is assumed by\nthe build tools to be an EDK II Package directory name.\n"},"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/33_platform_dsc_definition.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/33_platform_dsc_definition.html","title":"3.3 Platform DSC Definition","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

OFFSET_OF() macro in byte arrays that returns\nthe byte offset of a LABEL() declared in a byte array.\n\nNote: When using the characters \"|\" or \"||\" in an expression, the\nexpression must be encapsulated in open \"(\" and close \")\" parenthesis.\n\nNote: Comments may appear anywhere within a DSC file, provided they follow\nthe rules that a comment may not be enclosed within Section headers, and that\nin line comments must appear at the end of a statement.\n\nParameters\nExpression\nThere is also a membership expression, using the non-C \"in\" operator, which\nallows for testing if an item is present in a list. The usage of this\nmembership expression is restricted to testing architectures, targets and tool\nchain tag names that are being built. Refer to the EDK II Expression Syntax\nSpecification for additional information.\nUnicodeString\nWhen the  element (these characters are string literals as\ndefined by the C99 specification: L\"string\"/L'string', not actual Unicode\ncharacters) is included in a value, the build tools may be required to expand\nthe ASCII string between the quotation marks into a valid UCS-2 character string.\nThe build tools parser must treat all content between the field separators\n(excluding white space characters around the field separators) as ASCII literal\ncontent when generating the AutoGen.c and AutoGen.h files.\nComments\nStrings that appear in comments may be ignored by the build tools. An ASCII\nstring matching the format of the ASCII string defined by \n(L\"Foo\" for example,) that appears in a comment must never be expanded by any\ntool.\nCFlags\nCFlags refers to a string of valid arguments appended to the command line of\nany third party or provided tool. It is not limited to just a compiler\nexecutable tool. MACRO values that appear in quoted strings in CFlags content\nmust not be expanded by parsing tools.\nOA\nOther Architecture - One or more user defined target architectures, such as ARM\nor PPC. The architectures listed here must have a corresponding entry in the\nEDK II meta-data file, Conf/tools_def.txt. Only IA32, X64, COMMON and\nEBC are routinely validated.\nFileSep\nFileSep refers to either the back slash \"\\\" or forward slash \"/\" characters\nthat are used to separate directory names. All EDK II DSC files must use the\n\"/\" forward slash character when specifying the directory portion of a\nfilename. Microsoft operating systems, that normally use a back slash character\nfor separating directory names, will interpret the forward slash character\ncorrectly.\nCArray\nAll C data arrays used in PCD value fields must be byte arrays. The C format\nGUID style is a special case that is permitted in some fields that use the\n nomenclature.\nCData\nAll C data used in PCD value CODE syntax can be C style value to initialize \nC structure or Array in C source code.\nEOL\nThe DOS End Of Line: \"0x0D 0x0A\" character must be used for all EDK II\nmeta-data files. All Nix based tools can properly process the DOS EOL\ncharacters. Microsoft based tools cannot process the Nix style EOL characters.\n3.3.2 MACRO Statements\nUse of MACRO statements is optional.\nSummary\nMacro statements are characterize by a DEFINE token or may be defined on a\ncommand line of a parsing tool.\nDefine statements are processed according to the following precedence.\nHighest Priority\n\nCommand-line option -D MACRO=Value\n\nMost recent in file\n\nMacros defined in the DSC file's [Defines] section\n\n\nLowest Priority\nMacros defined in the [Defines] section are considered global during the\nprocessing of the FDF file and the DSC file. \nMacros are not allowed to redefine the reserved words specified in this file.\nFor example, it is not permitted to DEFINE DEFINE = FOOBAR, then use FOOBAR\nas a the reserved word.\nA macro that is not defined has a value of 0.\nIf the Macro statement is within the [Defines] section, then the Macro is\ncommon to the entire file as well as common to the FDF file, with later\ndefinitions overriding previous values (if the same MACRO name is used in\nsubsequent sections, then the MACRO value overrides all remaining instances\nthat following the definition.)\nMacro statements referenced before they are defined are \"undefined\" (for the\n!ifndef and !ifdef conditional directive statements).\nIf the tools encounter a macroval used in a directive, an expression or a value\nfield, as in $(MACRO), that is not defined, the macro will have a value of 0\nand, as in C programming, the build may break.\nWhile it is recommended that tools catch exceptions for incorrect content, they\nmay report the error on the line that uses the macro, $(MACRO), rather than\nwhere the macro was defined.\nPrototype\n ::= {}\n     ::=  \"DEFINE\"    [] \n           ::= {} {} {}\n                      {} {} {}\n                      {} {} {}\n                      {} {}\n\nRestrictions\nSystem Environment Variables\nSystem environment variable may not be re-defined in this file. System\nenvironment variables cannot be overridden by the build system tools.\nToken and Statements\nIt is not permissible to use $(MACRO) to replace a token or a complete token\nstatement. Tokens are the keywords defined in this specification.\nValues\nThe macro's value must not include any  character sequences. (Using \\r\nand \\n within a quoted string is permitted.\nParameters\nExpression\nRefer to the EDK II Expression Syntax Specification for additional information.\n\nNote: MACRO values defined in the [Defines] _section and PCD values\ndefined in this file may be used in the Flash FDF file.\n\nExamples:\nDEFINE GEN_SKU = MyPlatformPkg/GenPei\nDEFINE SKU1 = MyPlatformPkg/Sku1/Pei\nDEFINE HACK = DEBUG\n3.3.3 Conditional Directive Blocks\nUse of conditional directive blocks is optional.\nSummary\nThe conditional statements may appear anywhere within the file. Conditional\ndirective blocks can be nested.\n\nAll conditional directives can use MACRO, FixedAtBuild or FeatureFlag PCD\nvalues, which must evaluate to either \"True\" or \"False\".\n\nDirectives must be the only statement on a line.\n\nString evaluations are permitted, and are case sensitive; the two string\nvalues must be an exact match to evaluate to \"True\".\n\nThe expression immediately following the \"!if\" statement controls whether\nthe content after the line is processed or not. TRUE is any non-zero and/or\nnon-null value other than zero.\n\nEach \"!if\" within the source code must be matched with a closing \"!endif\".\n\nZero or more \"!elseif\" statements are permitted; only one \"!else\"\nstatement is permitted.\n\nConditional directive blocks may be nested.\n\nKeyword !ifdef, !ifndef, !if, !elseif, !else, !endif are case-insensitive.\n\nDirectives can be used to encapsulate entire sections or elements within a\nsingle section, such that they do not break the integrity of the section\ndefinitions.\n\nDirectives are in-fix expressions that are evaluated left to right; content\nwithin parenthesis is evaluated before the outer statements are evaluated.\nUse of parenthesis is recommended to remove ambiguity.\n\nThe values of the FixedAtBuild and FeatureFlag PCDs used in the conditional\nstatements must be set in the [PcdsFixedAtBuild] or [PcdsFeatureFlag]\nsection(s) of this DSC file. Other forms of PCDs cannot be used in\nconditional directive statements.\n\nDefault PCD values from the DEC files cannot be used in conditional\ndirectives within the DSC file; all PCD values used in directive statements\nmust be defined in the DSC file.\n\n\nConditional directives may appear before a Macro, FixedAtBuild or FeatureFlag\nPCD has been defined. Therefore, the reference build tools must perform two\npasses on this file:\n\nObtain the values of the MACROs, FixedAtBuild and FeatureFlag PCDs which are\nused for the conditional directives (these values must not be located within\na conditional directive).\n\nEvaluate the conditional statements for inclusion in the build.\n\n\nIf the value of a FixedAtBuild or FeatureFlag PCD used in a conditional\ndirective cannot be determined during the first pass, the build must break. It\nis permissible to have a Macro that is undefined after the first pass. Macros\nmust be defined before they can be used in an expression. Macros, FixedAtBuild\nand FeatureFlag PCDs used in conditional statements in the first pass must not\nbe located within conditional directives.\nThe build system must break if a PCD in the directive is listed in\n[PcdsPatchableInModule], [PcdsDynamic] or [PcdsDynamicEx] section.\n\nNote: PCDs, used in conditional directives, must be defined and the value\nset in either the FDF or DSC file in order to be used in a conditional\nstatement; values from INF or DEC files are not permitted.\n\nPrototype\n       ::=  \n                        *\n                        []\n                         \"!endif\" \n       ::= { \"!if\"   }\n                        { \"!ifdef\"   }\n                        { \"!ifndef\"   }\n                        *\n        ::= {} {} {}\n          ::= _ValidStatements_\n ::= _ValidStatements_\n ::=  \"!elseif\"  \n                        \n                        *\n   ::=  \"!else\" \n                        *\n\nRestrictions\nMACRO and PCD Values\nWhen a MACRO is used in conditional directives !if or !elseif, the\n - $(MACRO) - format is used. When a PCD is used in a conditional\ndirective (or in an expression) just the PcdName format is used.\nNumber values\nFor Numeric expressions, numbers must not be encapsulated by double quotation\nmarks\nStrings\nStrings in PCD elements must be NULL terminated. The NULL character is not\npart of the string that is tested. All other string comparisons do not include\nthe double quotation marks encapsulating the string. If the string is\n\"myapple\", the only characters that would be tested are myapple. When using\nstrings in the expression statements, there must be a comparison operator.\nParameters\nValidStatements\nAny valid section, multiple sections, section statement or set of section\nstatements defined in this specification may be within the scope of the\nconditional statements.\nMACRO Usage in Expression Statements\nA macro is said to be defined if and only if it has been set to a non-NULL\nvalue. When used in the !ifdef and !ifndef statement, the \nformat is being deprecated.\nPcdFeatureFlag\nThe FeatureFlag PCD is a boolean PCD that is set to either True (1) or\nFalse (0). The PCD datum type for a Feature PCD is always BOOLEAN. It may\nbe used in a logical expression.\nFixedPcdName\nA FixedAtBuild PCD will have a set value at build time, and the value cannot be\nmodified in the binary image, nor modified at runtime. For directives, the PCD\ndatum type is limited to UINT8, UINT16, UINT32, UINT64, UINTN and\nBOOLEAN. Using a FixedAtBuild PCD that has a datum type of VOID* is limited\nto text-based comparisons in directives. Using a PCD that has a value of a byte\narray is not permitted. FixedAtBuild PCDs may be used in a logical expression.\nNumeric Expressions\nThis is a test of numbers, using relational or equality operators, that\nevaluates to TRUE or FALSE\nLogical Expressions\nThis is a test where the expression, MACRO value or PCD value (include\n or  used in an expression) must evaluate to either\nTRUE (1) or FALSE (0), no operators are required, however logical\noperators, as well full expressions can be used. (expressions that do not\nevaluate to TRUE or FALSE must break the build).\nString Expressions\nThe strings must be exactly identical in order to match. Literal strings must\nbe encapsulated by double quotation marks. There must be a comparison operator\nbetween two strings (using a string without an operator is not permitted).

The included file's content must match the content of the\nsection that the !include statement resides, or it may contain completely new\nsections. If the included file starts with a section header, then the section\nbeing processed in the Platform DSC file is considered to have been terminated.\nIf the  contains \"$\" characters, then macros defined in the DSC\nfile and the system environment variable $(WORKSPACE) are substituted into .\nThe tools look for  relative to the directory the DSC file resides.\nIf the file is not found, and a directory separator is in , the\ntools attempt to find the file in a WORKSPACE (or a directory listed in the\nPACKAGES_PATH) relative path. If the file cannot be found, the build system\nmust exit with an appropriate error message.\nStatements in the include file are permitted to override previous definitions\nas well as to define new entries.\nThe keyword !include is case-insensitive.\nPrototype\n ::=  \"!include\"   \nExample (EDK II DSC)\n!include MyPlatformPkg/feature_pcds.mak\n!include MyFeatures.mak\n!include $(WORKSPACE)/PackageDir/Features.dsc\n!include $(MACRO1)/AnotherDir/$(MACRO2)/Features.dsc\n\nNote: The extension used in the example, \"mak\", is just a three\ncharacter extension, and would not processed by make or nmake commands. It\nmight just as well have been \"foo\".\n\n3.3.5 !error Statements\nUse of this statement is optional.\nSummary\nThis section defines the !error statement in EDK II Platform (DSC) files.\nThis statement is used to cause build tool to stop at the location where the\nstatement is encountered and error message following the !error statement\nis output as a message.\nThe keyword !error is case-insensitive.\nPrototype\n ::=  \"!error\"   \n   ::= \nParameters\nErrorMessage\nIt should in the same line with !error statement, and it can consist of several\nwords not necessarily in quotes.\nExample (EDK II DSC)\n!error \"unsupported feature!\"\n"},"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/34_header_section.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/34_header_section.html","title":"3.4 Header Section","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

This\nsection is created by the developer and is an input to the EDK II parsing\nutilities. Elements may appear in any order. Some of the entries in this\nsection are emitted to the output makefiles.\nEntries in this section are global to the both the DSC and FDF files and may be\nused as MACRO statement using the form $(MACRO_NAME).\nThe value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY can be referenced in other meta-data and\nmakefiles as $(OUTPUT_DIRECTORY). Likewise, BUILD_NUMBER can be referenced\nin later on in this file (or may be used in files specified in the DSC file) as\n$(BUILD_NUMBER).\n\nNote: The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY value must be either a full path to the\noutput directory, or a WORKSPACE relative path.\n\nSome entries are used by build tools in conjunction with other meta-data files\nand command-line options for context sensitive processing. The BUILD_TARGETS\nvalue describes the possible build targets that can be built, with\ntools_def.txt, target.txt and command-line options limiting the context of\nthe current build process. For example, if BUILD_TARGETS is set to\nDEBUG|RELEASE, and the two tool configuration files, target.txt and\ntools_def.txt permit building both of these targets, and no target is\nspecified on the command-line of the build command, the tool will perform two\nbuilds of the platform, one DEBUG followed by a build for RELEASE. The two\nentries that are scoped in this manner are SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES and\nBUILD_TARGETS. These items may be referenced as $(TARGET) and $(ARCH) in\nother meta-data files.\n\nNote: Assignments of variables in other sections take precedence over\nglobal assignments.\n\nThis revision of specification does not add new features. New EDK II DSC files\nmust include the statement: DSC_SPECIFICATION = 0x0001001C in this section.\nExisting DSC files do not need to update the value.\nIndividual items must appear on a single line, they may not span multiple lines.\nOf special note is the FLASH_DEFINITION file name. Unlike other file names in\nthe document, if the value does not include a full path, the file name is\nrelative to the location of the DSC file and NOT relative to the WORKSPACE.\nIf the FLASH_DEFINITION entry is not specified, the build tools assume that\nthe target output is one or more UEFI_APPLICATION modules.\nThe VPD_TOOL_GUID definition must use the registry format GUID of the tool\ndefined in the Conf/tools_def.txt file. If present, the build system will\ngenerate a temporary file and call the tool identified by this GUID value. The\ntool must provide two output files, an ordered list of VPD PCDs with offsets\nand values, as well as a binary file containing the VPD data. Refer to the EDK\nII Build Specification for information about using \"VPD PCD Data\".\nAll \"reserved\" words in the [Defines] section can be used in \nformat in this file and in the FDF file. For example, $(PLATFORM_NAME) can be\nused in processing both this file and the FDF file.\nThe statements may appear in any order; the order shown in the EBNF below is\nonly a recommendation.\nUse of , $(MACRO), for values is permitted within this section,\nhowever the macros must be defined before they can be used. It is recommended\nto not use macros for the DSC_SPECIFICATION, RFC_LANGUAGES, ISO_LANGUAGES,\nBUILD_TARGETS and SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES.\nThe !include statement may be used in a [Defines] section.\nPrototype\n      ::= \"[Defines]\" \n                   *\n   ::=  \"DSC_SPECIFICATION\"   \n                    \"PLATFORM_NAME\"   \n                    \"PLATFORM_GUID\"    \n                   \"PLATFORM_VERSION\"    [\n                   \"SKUID_IDENTIFIER\"   ]\n                    \"SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES\"   \n                    \"BUILD_TARGETS\"    [\n                   \"OUTPUT_DIRECTORY\"   ]\n                   [ \"FLASH_DEFINITION\"   ] [\n                   \"BUILD_NUMBER\"   ]\n                   [ \"RFC_LANGUAGES\"   ]\n                   [ \"ISO_LANGUAGES\"   ] [\n                   \"TIME_STAMP_FILE\"   ]\n                   [ \"VPD_TOOL_GUID\"  \n                   ]\n                   [ \"PCD_VAR_CHECK_GENERATION\"   ]\n                   [ \"PREBUILD\"   ]\n                   [ \"POSTBUILD\"   ]\n                   [ ]\n                   *\n                   *\n    ::= {} {(0-9)+ \".\" (0-9)+}\n    ::=  [ ]*\n     ::=  [ ]*\n ::= \"FIX_LOAD_TOP_MEMORY_ADDRESS\"   \n      ::= \n ::= _Target_ [ _Target_]*\n      ::= [] \n ::= [] \n      ::= (a-zA-Z) \":\"\n  ::= \n  ::=   []* \n      ::= \";\" \n  ::=   []* \n       ::= \n  ::= RFC4646 Format Language code\n                             ::= ISO 639-2 Format Language code\n           ::= {\"TRUE\"} {\"FALSE\"}\n       ::= []  []\n      ::= {} {}\n\nParameters\nSpecVal\nNew DSC files or DSC files that get updated to use any of the new features\ndefined in this specification must ensure that the 0x0001001C value is used.\nThe EDK II build system must maintain backward compatibility, therefore, there\nis no requirement to change existing DSC files if no other content changes.\nThis value may also be specified as a decimal value of 1.28.\nSkuUiName\nIf specified, the image created from the DSC/FDF file pair will only be valid\nfor the SkuUiNames listed. If not specified, and the [SKUIDS] section is\ndefined, the image is valid for all SkuIds listed in the [SKUIDS] section.\nRFC4646 Language Code\nOne or more language codes, formatted per RFC4646, using a semi-colon list\nseparator (example: \"en;en-US;es;es-419;fr;fr-FR;zh-Hans-CN\".) This list can be\nused to filter the output of tools that generate unicode strings. For example,\nif the unicode strings file defines 50 different languages for each string, but\nthe platform integrator only wants to support only three languages, then\nspecifying the three language codes in this statement will limit the final\noutput of string parsing tools to strings for these three languages. Tools must\nuse a \"Get Best Language\" function when filtering the content. The\nRFC_LANGUAGES statement must be used when processing EDK II Modules. Space\ncharacters are not permitted within the list.\nBuildNumber\nThis value, if present, will be used during the creation of\nEFI_SECTION_VERSION sections. Values in this file override any values set in\nthe INF files. If not present, the EDK II build tools must use a value of 0.\nTarget\nAll BUILD_TARGET values must be defined in the Conf/tools_def.txt file. Three\npredefined targets, NOOPT, DEBUG and RELEASE exist, however users may\nchoose to add their own targets in the Conf/tools_def.txt file (e.g., PERF or\nSHRINK).\nFLASH_DEFINITION Filename\nThe FDF filename must be either relative to the directory that contains this\nDSC file, or it can be absolute, as well as relative to the WORKSPACE .\nInterpreter\nAn interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. Python,\ninstructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously\ncompiling them into a machine language program.\nExample\n[Defines]\n  PLATFORM_NAME           = NT32\n  PLATFORM_GUID           = EB216561-961F-47EE-9EF9-CA426EF547C2\n  PLATFORM_VERSION        = 0.3\n  DSC_SPECIFICATION       = 0x0001001C\n  OUTPUT_DIRECTORY        = Build/Nt32\n  SUPPORTED_ARCHITECTURES = IA32\n  BUILD_TARGETS           = DEBUG|RELEASE\n  RFC_LANGUAGES           = \"en-us;\n  zh-hans;fr-fr\"\n  SKUID_IDENTIFIER        = SkuTwo|DEFAULT\n\n"},"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/36_[buildoptions]_sections.html":{"url":"3_edk_ii_dsc_file_format/36_[buildoptions]_sections.html","title":"3.6 [BuildOptions] Sections","keywords":"","body":"\n\n  Redistribution and use in source (original document form) and 'compiled'\n  forms (converted to PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) with or without\n  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  1) Redistributions of source code (original document form) must retain the\n     above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n     disclaimer as the first lines of this file unmodified.\n\n  2) Redistributions in compiled form (transformed to other DTDs, converted to\n     PDF, epub, HTML and other formats) must reproduce the above copyright\n     notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n     documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n  THIS DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED BY TIANOCORE PROJECT \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\n  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.

Of special note, a\n element within a quoted string is not expanded by the tools. The\n in the  element within a quoted string that is a system\nenvironment variable or a pre-defined \"Wellknown Macro\" (see Macro\nStatements, Section 2.2.6) does not need to be defined in this file, as the\nexpectation is that other tools will be responsible for expanding the macro.\nThis section is used to replace flags or append flags to the end of the tool\ncode flags defined in the tools_def.txt file. The Family tag can be used\nfor elements that are shared between different architectures, and different\ntool chain tag names.\nThe [BuildOptions] section modifier, CodeBase, (value is EDKII) allows for \nplatform integrators to override default build\noptions set in the tools_def.txt file scoped according to the type of INF\nfile being processed. EDK II INF files all contain an INF_VERSION element in\ntheir [Defines] section. The [BuildOptions] section of an INF file override both the\ntools_def.txt options and the options set in the [BuildOptions] section. In\norder to override options set in the INF file, the options must be overridden\nusing the INF scoped  tag after an INF file specified in the\n[Components] section.\nItems in these sections are either appended or replace options specified\nearlier.\nBuild options priority (appended from lowest to highest and/or highest\nreplacement) is:\n\nHighest, DSC file's component scoped  for individual INF\nfiles.\n[BuildOptions.$(arch).CodeBase.ModuleType]\n[BuildOptions.$(arch).CodeBase]\n[BuildOptions.common.CodeBase]\n[BuildOptions.$(arch)]\n[BuildOptions.common]\n[BuildOptions]\nINF File's [BuildOptions] section\nLowest - tools_def.txt entry\n\nAn example using the Family tag follows:\nMSFT:*_*_*_CC_FLAGS = /D MDEPKG_NDEBUG\nAn optional, special Family tag can be used at the start of the command line,\nusing a colon \":\" character after the Family tag. If not specified,\nspecific tool chain tags must be specified (the use of the asterisk \"*\" wild\ncard character is not permitted.)\n\nNote: The following is an example which does not use the Family tag, and\nspecific to a specific tool chain tag name:\n\nRELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4 /Gs8192 /Gy\nTwo types of assignment operators are permitted, the single equal \"=\" sign is\nused to append the string to the existing definition, while the double equal\n\"==\" sign is used to override any previous definition, replacing the content\nwith just the string. For example, given:\n[BuildOptions]\n  RELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4 /Gs8192 /Gy\n\nThen the following was found in a higher priority section, as in:\n[BuildOptions.common.EDKII]\n  RELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS == /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4\n\nThe logical results \"clear\" the /Gs8192 and /Gy flags - no other flags from the\ntools_def.txt or other [BuildOptions] sections will apply - as in:\nRELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS == /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4\nHowever, if a module as a  sub-section defined, as in:\nMyModule.inf {\n  \n    RELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS = /D EFI_DEBUG\n}\n\nThen, the logical result for building just my module would be:\nRELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS == /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4 /D EFI_DEBUG\nOther modules without the  sub-section would have the logical:\nRELEASE_MYTOOLS_IA32_CC_FLAGS == /nologo /c /WX /GS- /W4\nWhen one or more architectural modifiers are used in the section tag, as in\n[BuildOptions.IA32, BuildOptions.X64], the option lines will be sorted such\nthat the common lines appear in both IA32 sub-directory and X64 sub-directory\nmakefiles. Furthermore, using the architectural modifiers in the \nfield of the  listed below, additional sorting will be done.\nSections that have identical names are appended to each other in the order that\nthey appear in the file. Sections with modifiers are logically appended,\nstarting with the common, then (for each architecture) the architectural\nsection, followed by sections that use a code-base modifier.\nAssume that tools_def.txt defines the following:\n*_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /a\nThen,\n[BuildOptions.common]\n  # entries in this section are append to or replace items that\n  # may have been defined in the tools_def.txt file.\n  *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /b\n\nThe result would logically be: *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b\n[BuildOptions.common.EDKII]\n  # Entries in this field are appended for EDK II modules only\n  *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /c\n\nThe result for EDK II modules would be: *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b /c\n[BuildOptions.common.EDKII]\n  # Entries are for EDK II components and libraries\n  *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /d\n\nThe result for EDKII components and libraries would be: *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b /d\n[BuildOptions.IA32]\n  # Architectural options for IA32\n  *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /e\n\nThe logical result is: *_*_IA32_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b /c /e\n[BuildOptions.X64.EDKII]\n  # Architectural options for X64\n  *_*_*_TEST_FLAGS       = /f\n  DEBUG_*_*_TEST_FLAGS   = /g\n  RELEASE_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /h\n\nThe logical result is two sets of flags: DEBUG_*_X64_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b /d /f /g\nand RELEASE_*_X64_TEST_FLAGS = /a /b /d /f /h\nThe wildcard character \"*\" is permitted in the Target, Tagname and TargetArch\nfields of the . Specifying the wildcard character means that any\nvalue can be substituted. The values of the well-known macros, $(TARGET),\n$(TOOL_CHAIN_TAG) and $(ARCH) will be used by the tool in place of the\nwildcard character by the tools. If the platform build uses multiple\narchitectures, the build tools will automatically sort the statements, putting\nstatements into the appropriate makefiles.\nEntries in [BuildOptions] sections are cumulative (as opposed to last line\ntakes precedence in other section of the DSC file) provided the \"==\"\ncharacter sequence is not used in statement later in the section. For example,\ngiven the two following lines in a section:\n*_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /e\n*_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /f\nThe logical result is:\n*_*_*_TEST_FLAGS = /e /f\nPrototype\n ::= \"[BuildOptions\" [] \"]\"  *\n      ::= \".\"  [ [\".\" ]]\n     ::= \".\" {\"Common\"} {\"EDKII\"}\n   ::= {} {}\n                   { }\n   ::= {} {} {} {}\n     ::= [ \":\"]    \n     ::= [ \":\"]    \n      ::= [ \":\"]  \n                    \n        ::= [ \":\"]    \n        ::= {} {}\n     ::= \n    ::=  \"==\" \n       ::= _Family_\n     ::=  \"_\"  \"_\"  \"_\" \n     ::=  \"_FLAGS\"\n     ::=  \"_DPATH\"\n      ::=  \"_PATH\"\n    ::=  \"_\" \n   ::= _TargetArch_\n       ::= _Target_\n    ::= _AttributeName_\n      ::= _TagName_\n     ::= _ToolCode_\n        ::= _FlagString_\n      ::= [] \n\nParameters\nFamily\nMust match a FAMILY name defined in the EDK II tools_def.txt file.

Use of the quote characters around options is\nrequired when specifying string values with spaces, path names with spaces or\nvalues containing the hash \"#\" character not within a string. Note that a\nmacro named MDEPKG_NDEBUG is reserved for size reduction purposes. The user\nmust not use this keyword to define a new macro.\nExecCmd\nThe filename of an executable.

A PCD\ncan only be listed under one access method. All PCDs listed in these sections\nmust be declared in a DEC file if the PCD is used in any modules listed in the\nDSC or FDF file.\nIf a PCD is listed in multiple PCD access method sections in the DEC file, the\nplatform integrator can decide which access method to use. If not listed in the\nDSC file, the tools are allowed to select a type, with the FixedAtBuild\naccess method being preferred.\nIt is not permissible to mix DynamicDefault with DynamicVpd or DynamicHii,\nnor is it permissible to mix DynamicVpd with Dynamic*Hii - only one storage\nmethod for a PCD is permitted.\n\nNote: The format for listing PCDs under Default, Vpd and HII sections\ndiffer significantly.\n\nOnly FeatureFlag PCDs can be listed in [PcdsFeatureFlag] sections.\nPCD Values specified in the DSC file override any values specified in INF files\nor DEC files.\nIf no value is provided in the DSC file, then the value will come from INF\nfiles, provided all INF files define the same preferred value.\nIf the INF values differ (or are not listed), and the method for the PCD in all\nof the INF files is FixedAtBuild, then each module will use the value\nspecified in the INF file or the default value listed in the DEC file (for\nmodules that do not list a preferred value in the INF). Likewise, if the method\nis PatchableInModule in all INF files, then each module will also use the\nvalue specified in the INF file or the default value listed in the DEC file\n(for modules that do not list a preferred value). This same rule applies to\nFeatureFlag PCDs.\nIf the Source INF values differ (or are not listed) and the access methods are\ndifferent, then the build must break. All source modules in a platform must use\nthe same PCD same access method.\nBinary modules included in a platform build are permitted to use the\nPatchableInModule or DynamicEx access methods (the Binary module must specify\nwhich of these two methods were used to create the binary module) regardless of\nthe method used for a given PCD in modules built from source. The build supports\nbinary modules that use the same or different PCD access method than the source\nmodules or other binary modules. The build parser must break with an error if a\nPCD is listed as FixedAtBuild or Dynamic (not DynamicEx) in the Binary INF.\nIf no value is entered in the DSC file, and no INF files provide a preferred\nvalue, then the DEC file's default value must be used.\nIt is possible to have different default values based on architecture, and it\nis permissible to list multiple architectures in a single method section as in:\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild.IA32, PcdsFixedAtBuild.X64]\nIt is permissible to list a PCD in a common architecture section and also list\nit in an architecturally modified section. In this case, the value in the\narchitectural section overrides the value specified in the common section.\nThe PCD values must match the datum type declared for a given PCD in the DEC\nfile.\nPCDs with a data type of VOID* can optionally provide the maximum size of the\nvalue. If not provided, the maximum length will be calculated as the largest of\nthe size of the data in the DSC file, the size of the data in the INF file or\nthe size of the data in the DEC file that declares the PCD.\nPCDs with a C strucutre type is also a VOID PCD. Its value can be specified like\nnormal VOID PCD, and also be specified by its structure field.\nRefer to the EDK II Build Specification for the description of the PCD\nprocessing rules.\n3.9.1 [PcdsFeatureFlag] Sections\nThese are optional sections for EDK II DSC Files.\nSummary\nDefines the [PcdsFeatureFlag] section tag that may be required for platform\nDSC files that will use EDK II module INF files.\nThe !include statement is permitted in the [PcdsFeatureFlag] sections,\nalthough not recommended.\nThe PcdsFeatureFlag entry is a formatted string with two fields, separated by\nthe pipe character, \"|\".

The values listed below must match\nthe datum type specified in the DEC file that declares this PCD. If a PCD's\ndatum type is VOID* the MaximumDatumSize field is required. Specifying\ndifferent  values(Default, HII, or VPD) in one section\nheader is not permitted. It is permissible to specify different Architectures\nusing an identical  value. The following line is permissible:\n[PcdsDynamicDefault.X64.Default, PcdsDynamicDefault.EBC.Default]\nThe following line is incorrect, and must cause a build break during parsing of\nthe file:\n[PcdsDynamicDefault.X64.Default, PcdsDynamicVpd.EBC.Default]\nThe !include statement is permitted in [PcdsDynamic] sections, although not\nrecommended.\nThe Offset, MaximumDatumSize and Value fields are optional for the VPD PCD\nentries, and a wildcard character may be used for the Offset. The wildcard\ncharacter can only be used if a VPD_TOOL_GUID is specified in the [Defines]\nsection and the tool supports automatic calculation of the Offset. For VPD\nPCDs of type VOID, if the VPD's value is present, the MaximumDatumSize\nmust be given. For VOID PCDs, the size is the larger of the length of the\nspecified value, the length of default values in INF files that use PCD and the\nlength of the default value in the DEC file. If there are no values specified\nin any of the files, the build tools must break. If no value is specified in\nthe DSC file, and multiple INF files exist that define default values, then the\nbuild must break, since only one value can be used.\nThe PcdsDynamic entry is a formatted string consisting of three to six fields\nthat are separated by the pipe character, \"|\".

The offset value must not exceed the maximum value of\n0xFFFF (UINT16).\nHiiString\nThe HiiString field in the HII format PCD entry must not be an empty string.\nSkuIds\nSkuIds in the DSC file can be used in two different ways. They can be used to\nas conditional modifiers to exclude some content from a build, or they can be\nused to identify and group content during a build. If no SkuId option (-x)\nis present on the command-line, or defined in the [Defines] section, then the\nbuild system must group content by SkuId. If a SkuId option is present on\nthe command-line, or one or more SkuIds are listed in the [Defines]\nsection, then the SkuId values are used to include specific content, while\nexcluding content for sections where the SkuId is not present in the list of\nSkuIds from either the command-line or from the SKUID_IDENTIFIER element in\nthe [Defines] section. Use of the SkuId modifier for the [PcdsDynamic*]\nsection tag can be used as a conditional modifier or to groups sets of PCDs\naccording to the SkuId identifier.\nDefaultStore\nDefaultStore in the DSC file is used to specify DynamicHii/DynamicExHii PCD \nvalue as the default EFI variable for which default store.

If the\nenvironment variable is not specified, the INF file path is assumed to be\nrelative to the WORKSPACE.\nThe following is an example of specifying a WORKSPACE (MdeModulePkg is in the\ndirectory pointed to by the WORKSPACE environment variable) relative Path:\nMdeModulePkg/Universal/Disk/DiskIo/Dxe\nThe following is an example of specifying an Indirect Path:\nDEFINE FOUNDATION_LIB = $(WORKSPACE)/Foundation/Library\n$(FOUNDATION_LIB)/EdkIIGlueLib/EntryPoints\n\nThe permitted DEFINE statement must be a variable name assigned to a path.\nEDK II DSC files allow specifying only one optional argument on an INF file\nentry line. The argument, EXEC = filename, is used for User Defined\nprocessing of an INF file. The EDK II parsing tools will call the program\nlisted by filename (which must either be in the OS PATH environment, or fully\nqualified path and filename) with the INF filename (expanded) as the one and\nonly argument to filename.\nEDK II modules can have scoped (scoping encapsulation between \"{\" and \"}\"\nbraces) sub-elements, ,  and/or  that\nallow individual modules to supersede previous definitions. The values\nspecified on the command-line have the highest precedence followed by values\nspecified in the sub-elements. Refer to Section 2.4 regarding how build\noptions are used by the EDK II build tools, as well as the EDK II Build\nSpecification.\nThe PCD access methods (and storage methods) are selected on a platform basis -\nit is not permitted to have a PCD listed in one of the Pcd sections and use it\ndifferently in an individual module. For example, if a PCD is listed in a\n[PcdsFixedAtBuild] section, it is not permitted to list it in a\n sub-section of an INF file.\nIt is permitted to have a PatchableInModule PCD or FixedAtBuild PCD with\ndifferent values. If a PCD is listed in [PcdsFixedAtBuild] section with one\nvalue, while the  section of an INF use a different value.\nThe FeatureFlag PCD and the two dynamic forms of PCDs are common to a platform,\nwith the dynamic form PCD values stored in a \"runtime database\", read-only\nmemory location or an HII data store. Therefore, having different values is\nprohibited for these access methods.\nThe format for items listed in the sub-elements is the identical format for\ncontent under the section.\nWithin the context of an EDK II module sub-element, the \nentries must appear before  entries; the  entries\nterminate with the start of either the  or \nsub-section header or the end of the scope defined by the right curly \"}\"\nbrace. The  sub-element must be the last sub-entry of an EDK II\nmodule's scoped section. Entries for ,  and\n are used to replace the platform or global definition entries\nlisted elsewhere. LibraryClass and PCDs are globally defined in the DSC\nfile's [LibraryClasses] and [Pcds*] sections, while global BuildOptions\nmay be specified in either the DSC file's [BuildOptions] section or in the\n$(WORKSPACE)/Conf/tools_def.txt file.\nComponents and modules listed here will be processed during the MAKE phase of\nthe build. Binary EDK II only modules do not need to be listed in this section,\nbut can be put into the FDF file. If a Binary INF listed in the FDF file has\ndynamic or PatchableInModule PCDs, the INF should be listed in the DSC\nfile.Build tools will use the order of files specified in this section for\nperforming a build (Library Class Instances will be built prior to the module's\nsources,) however the ordering in this file has no effect on the ordering of\nmodules in a binary image (the FDF file describes that ordering).\nPrototype\n       ::= \"[Components\" [] \"]\" \n                       *\n          ::=  [\",\"  \"Components\" ]*\n            ::= \".\" \n ::= {}\n                       {} { }\n         ::=  [ ] \n          ::= {} {}\n      ::=   \".inf\"\n             ::= \"EXEC\"  \n     ::=   [\".\" ]\n    ::=  # An OS recognisable extension that will #\n                       automatically be run.\n       ::= \"{\" \n                       [ ]\n                       [ ]\n                       [ ]\n                       [ ]\n                       [ ]\n                       [ ] \"}\"\n           ::= \"\" \n                        \"FILE_GUID\"   \n   ::= \"\"  *\n        ::= {} {} {\n                       }\n ::= {} {}\n ::=    \n        ::= (A-Z)(a-zA-Z0-9)*\n ::= \"NULL\"   \n  ::= \"\"  \n                        *\n    ::= {} {} {\n                       }\n  ::=    \n  ::= {} {} {}\n        ::= \"\" \n                        *\n       ::= {} {}\n                       { }\n    ::= \"\" \n                       *\n         ::=  [ ] \n         ::= if (pcddatumtype == \"BOOLEAN\"):\n                         {} {}\n                       elif (pcddatumtype == \"UINT8\"):\n                         {} {}\n                       elif (pcddatumtype == \"UINT16\"): \n                         {} {}\n                       elif (pcddatumtype == \"UINT32\"):\n                         {} {}\n                       elif (pcddatumtype == \"UINT64\"):\n                         {} {}\n                       else:\n                          []\n          ::=  \"VOID*\" [ ]\n        ::= {} {}\n      ::= {} {} {}\n     ::= \"\" \n                       []*\n                       [ ]+\n                       [ ]*\n                       [ ]*\n                       [ ]*\n        ::= [ \":\"]    \n         ::=  \"_\"  \"_\"  \"_\" \n         ::=  \"_FLAGS\"\n         ::= [ \":\"]    \n         ::=  \"_DPATH\"\n          ::= [ \":\"]    \n          ::=  \"_PATH\"\n          ::=   [\".\" ]\n        ::= (a-zA-Z)(a-zA-Z0-9_-)*\n            ::= [ \":\"] \n        ::=  \"_\"   \n            ::= {} {}\n         ::= \n        ::=  \"==\" \n            ::= {\"IA32\"} {\"X64\"} {\"EBC\"} {*} {}\n               ::= (A-Z) (A-Z0-9)*\n           ::= _Family_\n        ::= _Attribute_\n           ::= _Target_\n          ::= _TagName_\n         ::= _ToolCode_\n            ::= _FlagString_\n\nParameters\nTarget\nMust match a target identifier in the EDK II tools_def.txt file - the first\nfield, where fields are separated by the underscore character.

Use of\nsymbols follows the makefile convention of enclosing within $(), for example\n$(EDK_SOURCE). As the parsing utility processes files, it will often perform\nparsing of variable assignments. These variables can then be referenced in\nother sections of the DSC file. Variable assignments will be saved internally\nin either a local or global symbol table. The local symbol table is purged\nfollowing processing of individual Platform (DSC) files. Global symbol values\npersist throughout execution of the utility. Local symbol values take precedent\nover global symbols. The following table describes the symbols generated\ninternally by the utility. They can be overridden either on the command line,\nin the DSC file, or in individual INF files. The symbols in the table below are\ntypically global.\nFor a pure EDK II build, two environment variables are required to be set prior\nto executing any build, WORKSPACE and EDK_TOOLS_PATH must be set. point to\nthe Location of the BaseTools directory tree. When EDK II Packages are in\ndirectories that are not under a single directory, then the PACKAGES_PATH and\nEDK_TOOLS_BIN (Windows builds only) directories must also be set.\nFor a build using EDK components in the EDK II DSC file, the EDK_SOURCE\ndirectory must point to the root of the EDK (either a directory containing an\nEDK tree or the location of the EdkCompatibilityPkg directory) tree.\nTable 10 Standard Variables\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nWORKSPACE\nDefines the root directory of the local development tree, for example C:\\work. If not defined as an environmental variable when an EDK II tool is invoked, the utility will give an error message and exit. If the development tree contains sub-directories that contain EDK II Packages, then this variable must be set prior to running edksetup.bat.\n\n\nEDK_TOOLS_PATH\nDefines the root directory of the local EDK II BaseTools directory.\n\n\nPACKAGES_PATH\nThis variable is not permitted in EDK II meta-data files.\n\n\n\nThis variable contains an ordered list of directories that contain EDK\n\n\n\nII Package directories. This is NOT required if the development tree (defined by the WORKSPACE) contains all EDK II Packages used for development. If the development tree contains sub-directories that contain EDK II Packages (i.e., C:\\work\\edk2\\MdePkg,\n\n\n\nC:\\work\\edk2\\MdeModulePkg, C:\\work\\myplatform\\MyPlatformPkg) then this variable must list all directories that contain EDK II Packages (i.e., PACKAGES_PATH=C:\\work\\edk2;C:\\work\\myplatform); this variable must be set prior to running edksetup.bat\n\n\nEDK_TOOLS_BIN\nThis variable is not permitted in EDK II meta-data files. This a Windows only variable that points to the EDK II BaseTools binary directory. If the WORKSPACE directory contains a\n\n\n\nBaseTools\\Bin\\Win32 directory and the directory is populated with the build tools, then this variable is not required. If the binaries are located in a different directory, i.e., C:\\work\\edk2-BaseTools-win32, then this variable must be set prior to running edksetup.bat\n\n\nEDK_SOURCE\nDefines the directory of an original EDK directory tree, for example C:\\EFI2.0\\EdkCompatibilityPkg. If not defined as an environmental variable when an EDK II tool is invoked, the utility will give an error message and exit.\n\n\nEFI_SOURCE\nDefines the root directory of a local original EDK source tree, for example C:\\EFI2.0\\MyEdkDriver.\n\n\nEFI_TOOLS_PATH\nDefines the root directory containing the original EDK Tools directory tree, for example C:\\Tools.\n\n\nEFI_TOOLS_BIN\nDefines the directory containing the original EDK Tools executable files. Default: $(EFI_TOOLS_PATH)/Bin\n\n\nPROCESSOR\nDefines the EDK target processor for which the code is to be built. This symbol will typically be used only in EDK INF files, and is ignored for pure EDK II builds.\n\n\nTARGET_ARCH\nThis defines which of the supported architectures will be built - this value is set in the file: $(WORKSPACE)/Conf/target.txt or it may be specified on a command-line.\n\n\nBUILD_DIR\nDefines the build tip directory for the current platform. For example, this may be $(OUTPUT_DIR)\\Platform\\Nt32.\n\n\nSOURCE_DIR\nFor a component, defines the directory of the component source files.\n\n\nDEST_DIR\nFor a component, defines the directory (typically under BUILD_DIR) where the component object files are to be built.\n\n\nLIB_DIR\nSpecifies the directory where EFI libraries are deposited after building. Default: $(BUILD_DIR)\\$(TARGET)_$(TAGNAME)\\$(ARCH)\\LIB\n\n\nBIN_DIR\nSpecifies the directory where final component binaries (.efi) are deposited during build. Default: $(BUILD_DIR)\\$(TARGET)_$(TAGNAME)\\$(ARCH)\n\n\nFV_DIR\nSpecifies a WORKSPACE relative or absolute directory where the final image files will be placed at the conclusion of a successful build. If the directory does not exist, the tools must create this directory. If not defined, tools must create an FV directory underneath the BIN_DIR.\n\n\nDSC_FILENAME\nName of the DSC file as specified on the command line. Can be used for dependencies in the makefiles.\n\n\nINF_FILENAME\nName of the INF file for a given EDK component or EDK II Module.
